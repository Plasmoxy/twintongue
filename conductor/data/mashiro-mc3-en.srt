00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,360
Good evening, today is Minecraft

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,880
It's so bad, I've only been eating oden every day lately.

10
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,000
Wow today is seven

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,799
oden deko and chia egg

12
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,479
Only Chiabu is not that Chikuwa.

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,599
What is Nechikuwabu?

14
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,200
What kind of person is talking about holding a pot?

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,360
It's white and sticky, like hearsay.

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,800
It's Nabu. I'm sorry, I don't know what Bu is.

17
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,400
No, no, but

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,720
I'm not talking about Nechooden, but I usually only sleep on my stomach.

19
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,440
That's what I said. Good luck today. It's probably my first time trying to sleep properly on my back.

20
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,920
It's the first time I've been able to sleep with this in mind. It's okay for everyone to lie on their backs today.

21
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,560
It was amazing. It was hard to sleep, but I tried my best to sleep on my back.

22
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,720
And I wake up feeling really good.

23
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:31,120
And I never had nightmares. When I dream, I definitely see demons.

24
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,239
I've had nightmares on any given day, but today is not a nightmare.

25
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:44,680
I don't remember what I dreamed about, but I'll do my best and turn around from now on.

26
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,439
I thought about sleeping in

27
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,280
Well, I guess it has something to do with sleeping. Lying on your stomach makes you more likely to have nightmares.

28
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,760
I heard that I'm playing Pokemon Sleep, and right now I'm making a selection of Eve and Gorse.

29
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,120
A selection that never ends

30
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,519
Later, Yasuya appears.

31
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,199
Pokemon sleep is divided into three types: nap, sleep, and sound sleep.

32
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:26,199
I can do it, but most of the time I'm sleeping soundly or dozing off.

33
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,240
It's not there, how can I get it out?

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,479
That's why I can't catch fire type Pokemon.

35
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:44,600
There's a strict selection of personalities and skills for Pokemon Sleep, and it all depends on that.

36
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,160
The points are different, so the higher the points, the rarer Pokemon you can get.

37
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,120
You can go to places where it gets easier, and it's pretty deep.PokÃ©mon Sweep

38
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,919
I finally reached level 21. I'm a level 37 Pokemon.

39
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm a big fan of sleep, so this is my first time using Pokemon Sleep.

40
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:19,080
I think people should choose Butterfree instead of Eve.

41
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,960
Yo Butterfree is seriously the strongest, so when I first started, I had two Butterfrees.

42
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:34,000
There were two Butterfrees, Golduck, Raichu, and Windy.

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,120
It's not listed on any strategy site, but it's Windy Maji.

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,240
I see a lot of people saying that the strongest Windy is normal, but for me, Windy is probably the best.

45
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,319
Netia Zetia S number 1

46
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Upper Windy is a skill that helps other Pokemon.

47
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,479
But that's serious

48
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,479
The strongest is so-so, so today it's Minecraft.

49
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:18,800
Well, first of all, let me explain the project.Eko's listener participation type project.This is me.

50
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:27,280
A plan to build anything you like inside the cat's square base that you have prepared.

51
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:39,080
So it's my third week this week, so let's see how far I've come.

52
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,360
Because it's Mashooi

53
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:55,720
Please give me flowers. I've opened a flower shop. That's why I log in every day.

54
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,360
I've been making it from time to time.

55
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,680
Yoko Nene also copied the building next door, but it's a complete copy.

56
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,840
I built a flower shop next to the cat's fish shop without permission.

57
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,400
This is a really nice block, but I think it could be used for a stylish shop.

58
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,400
This is a seriously stylish blog.

59
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:39,199
This is my ideal flower shop.It's really nice.

60
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,400
So, let's look at it as a whole.

61
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,360
But what has changed is that there is no longer a place where everyone can make it.

62
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,639
I see, you can just make the top part, just make sure to fill in all the gaps.

63
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,560
I want it, and I'm thinking of destroying it all.

64
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:13,080
But I made it randomly, but I'm going to destroy it.That's that huge tunnel I made.

65
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:21,000
I seriously can't think of a use for it, there are so many hidden routes.

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,080
If you look at the places where the number of people watching has increased, I really like it.Fill in the gaps.

67
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,240
I want it like this

68
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,240
And

69
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,399
Oh man, I was looking forward to this. It's not done yet. This is terrible.

70
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:51,560
No, I think it's probably an SCP facility, but the Foundation is serious about this.

71
00:08:51,560 --> 00:09:01,200
This is an enchanted room that's starting to look pretty good.

72
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,279
Something is starting to get done quite a bit.

73
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,680
That's right, this is it

74
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120
is a toilet

75
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,440
This is so nice

76
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,800
You really worked hard on the stairs.

77
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,959
dekoko

78
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,640
The flies are amazing

79
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:46,399
Wow, this is a containment breach. It's seriously a containment breach. I'm calling B here.

80
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,959
Do it, this is amazing

81
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,880
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

82
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,079
Jan Foundation Staff

83
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,839
This place is a big man's home.

84
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,920
What is it being used for?

85
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,519
I'm looking forward to seeing you there.There's a reference room here and there.

86
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,040
There was a block, this is paro, this is seriously amazing

87
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:38,160
This is without a shadow, so this is also this server, and if you add a shadow,

88
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,200
You made it because the amount of blocks had increased to the point where it was extremely heavy.

89
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,600
You can go check out Kacho's upper floor.

90
00:10:52,200 --> 00:11:00,240
It's so well made it's a big deal

91
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:09,560
What's amazing is that not all rooms have the same feel, but each room has its own unique feel.

92
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,040
Guide me by feeling

93
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,760
I just came to see Kururu, so I guess he'll show me around.

94
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:30,920
No, white matter, what is this?

95
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,240
Wow, this is the first time I've seen this.

96
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,399
They're working really hard on this duct.

97
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,360
I got something amazing, but I probably couldn't pick it up.

98
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,639
It's probably a block on the floor below.

99
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,839
In Nahon

100
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,519
Archive Komada?

101
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,320
This is World Elite. Only I can use it. Other people can't use it.

Welcome to the collection of temporary site 98, which has been certified.

106
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,959
Amazing parentheses

107
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,920
Go ahead and go

108
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,959
It's starting to double

109
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Teru

110
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
a

111
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:09,120
Wait a minute, I don't know, I'll see later

112
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,320
Let's take a look at that. It's the Back Rooms, right? The Back Rooms are also expanding day by day.

113
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,760
It's spreading more and more

114
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,440
What's above

115
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,079
It's amazing that things like Futoshi are being built here and there.

116
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,839
It makes me sleepy

117
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,959
I'm really looking forward to this and other things at a glance.

118
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,760
However, I haven't been able to do anything like this.

119
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,279
I guess it's still a legend

120
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,000
No, it looks like an amazing garden that has already been built.

121
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,759
I wonder if he's doing it by himself. It's really scary.

122
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:24,399
I saw something like Deyosu.A little while after I saw another outrageous thing.

123
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,800
Let's go see it too

124
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,320
Aine Izakaya Ramen

125
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,920
Well, everyone is doing well without world editing.

126
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,680
You're trying too hard

127
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:55,600
This is really bad, I saw this place like 000 and Spirited Away before.

128
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,480
Look ahead here

129
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,040
No, it's getting bigger and bigger

130
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,440
Teruhon is a little better or something like that.

131
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,120
Hey, if I recall correctly, you made that casino casino before, right?

132
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,160
What do you think? Is it finished?

133
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,680
What are you doing? I'll do it later.

134
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
casino

135
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:42,920
Something is being done here again.

136
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:56,079
Wow, it's a bit of an edgy venue.

137
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:04,560
School Swimsuit Cocoa also has a shop like that, and this is probably a shop like that.

138
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,560
sit and watch

139
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,079
of

140
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,920
Wow pole dancing

141
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:25,319
bread

142
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,519
Wow, this is a sensitive shop.

143
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,440
It was done before I knew it.

144
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:44,199
Maybe that or that game I did in collaboration.

145
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,440
That's amazing, that's an art museum, isn't it?

146
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,480
I saw this player from Bacochcha. A nice house has been built.

147
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,559
Teruko's stylish house. Maybe you haven't seen this.

148
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:20,439
Na Hotel Grand Shini Na Shini Naa 427 My Birthday

149
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,120
Neo

150
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,520
Stylish things are great, Viking Daiyappa bread

151
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,559
That scenery outside is scary

152
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,039
Is there a room at Naja Hotel?

153
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,559
Underground too

154
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:56,160
No, I want a pool, I'm in the process of building one.

155
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm bothering you, this is it

156
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,960
This restaurant has a more luxurious feel.

157
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,039
This is my first time seeing you. I came from a clipping. Welcome.

158
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,679
I'm watching this week's edition.

159
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,440
I'd like to build a pool if I can stay here.

160
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,400
No, this and that

161
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,440
The head of the awesome wither skeleton is now

162
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,440
This is amazing.

163
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,840
It's a stupid hobby

164
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Sea urchin and

165
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,640
A high quality live show came.

166
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:14,559
I wonder if Starry was made.During construction, things are starting to take shape.

167
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,200
I'm really looking forward to it

168
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:31,440
Didn't you see Amo in Dahon? I saw that too.

169
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,000
Kakoko

170
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,240
Nehon

171
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,960
So this is also added

172
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,720
octopus chinese style

173
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,559
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

174
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Jan

175
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Ah, there are many kinds of architecture that have a unique feel.

176
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,559
After all, I didn't do Only Up.

177
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,559
There is also a tatami room

178
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,600
That's nice.

179
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,200
Oh, I can see how it's just growling here.

180
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:50,480
They don't sell it anymore, so I bought it the day they stopped selling it.

181
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,120
I bought it on the very unlucky day when sales were suspended.

182
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Ta

183
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:11,520
Oh, there's something suspicious here. There's something behind this.

184
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,080
Zohoraada

185
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,880
But I can't go any further.

186
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm going to hide it. I'm going to hide my listener. I don't know where anything is.

187
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,240
is

188
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,279
I want to be able to go there on foot someday.

189
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,440
I can't go, I'll have to walk

190
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,760
I'm releasing this save data for sightseeing who wants to be able to go all on foot.

191
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,520
It's scheduled so the general public can enter.

192
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,279
to

193
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh this is here

194
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,919
It's been here for a long time, but there's no interior yet.

195
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,240
Nakocchihato

196
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,240
I saw something like a huge castle just now.

197
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Ken 3D Studio

198
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
oh

199
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,679
amazing 3d studio

200
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:59,960
You can cut out only here with a green bag.

201
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,320
this

202
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,880
Wow this is interesting

203
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,520
A space where you can climb with a ne

204
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,200
There's a shopping street.

205
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:35,080
Oh, it's done, it's done, it's Matsuya, it's Matsuya.

206
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:45,000
I saw a video of someone walking into Matsuya and leaving after 30 seconds of eating something at home.

207
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,240
The front is cute, this kind of logistics is nice behind the scenes

208
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,880
This is what I was looking for

209
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,520
scared

210
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:09,480
That's a figure

211
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,600
I can't help but feel like this is Coulomb.

212
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,720
Neyoshi

213
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,640
Okay, yes, yes, yes, shutter.

214
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,840
You can fill in the gaps with things like this and more like this.

215
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,039
That's why it doesn't matter what kind of architecture you want.

216
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,720
It's safe enough that there are

217
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,760
Daichi, do you want to go see the casino?

218
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,480
See the casino at the casino

219
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,159
Then go to the middle and go to the person who will introduce you this time.

220
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,600
Oh wait, there's one above too

221
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:23,760
It's an alien! They're being caught.

222
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,559
It's like an alien

223
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:33,799
How do I get in here?

224
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,120
I can't enter the lottery

225
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,120
Is this a cloud? It's a cloud's house.

226
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,760
What are you looking at? This place is dangerous.

227
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,679
Well done

228
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:07,520
Come on, I'm turning into a bunny because last week I told you to turn into a bunny.

229
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,320
Now that I'm Vanine, I'd like you to introduce me.

230
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,679
I can't play Ecoin, I'm really in the middle of this

231
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,000
What, this is seriously amazing

232
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,720
There is a guidebook on how to play Nae Roulette.

233
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,200
Roulette: Put a coin into the yellow box and press the center button to start. If you win, the game will turn purple.

234
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,320
twice the number you put in the box.

235
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:54,919
I see, I put the coin in the yellow box, but what if it's purple? Really?

236
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,600
I guess I'll do it here then.

237
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,919
Okay, let's go with 32 switches.

238
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,760
On amazing

239
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,159
My carp is gone

240
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:29,520
Just one more time, 16 pieces.

241
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:41,679
I guess there are a lot of people who don't get it right at all.

242
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,960
here this

243
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,399
Na

244
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,720
Yes, it's a shame

245
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,120
It's a shame, I don't get it at all, but I feel like this is the only place here

246
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,799
Let's put this and this three together 3

247
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,360
Hey [music]

248
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,399
It came true

249
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:30,600
That manager doesn't have any money, it's my money.

250
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,600
I can't give it back

251
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,519
Tao is gone

252
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,240
I don't have any octopus, I just bought one more

253
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,279
Or maybe it's a bug. That's amazing.

254
00:28:52,600 --> 00:29:01,120
Yo, this is a money exchange place.

255
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Toko

256
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,640
amazing slots

257
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:19,039
There are also nice bars in the area.

258
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:28,360
It's so nice that it makes me want to play an MMO.When I see something like this, I want to play slots.

259
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:35,120
Oh no, I can't even do this. I can play this too.

260
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:44,200
Well, I managed to win one.

261
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,440
It was amazing1

262
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,760
This is no good, this isn't bad.

263
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes, I'm sorry I broke it, I broke it.

264
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,080
Are you okay?

265
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:12,159
I'm sorry, I'm healed, Silka Box.

266
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:19,159
I broke it and couldn't open it.

267
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,039
Well, it's okay

268
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:39,919
Ah, thank you, 8 coins.

269

Takore is really interesting

271
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:58,799
Well, you can earn coins for the rest of your life.

272
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,200
It's not bad that it came out as if it was a confirmed performance.

273
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,080
Nice, this is so perfect.

274
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:19,720
Right, I'm still planning on making something else. What is this?

275

276
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,760
Eahahahaha

277
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,480
Yes, yes, it's pinball. Yes, this is difficult.

278
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:43,159
Let's do this together, okay, this is interesting.

279
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:51,120
What is this float? What is this float? Seriously?

280
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,159
Yes, yes, I'm only going to the middle, but okay.

281
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
Okay

282
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:08,480
First of all, yes, yes, yes, I have to do it properly.

283
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,519
I can't change it, yes, yes, yes.

284
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,039
Yes yes no

285
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,080
Even if you do this, you won't get any coins or anything.

That's amazing. This is seriously amazing.

Circuit Karokume's hand that I really respect

290
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:56,720
Hey, what is this? It's a rulebook. When you press the button at your feet, you get 1 card.

291
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,360
It will go into the blue box on the right.Press the button in order.Multiple places at the same time.

292
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,000
If you press it, it may not work properly.To exchange cards, discard the cards in the red box on the left, and then press the red box on the left for that many cards.

293
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Please press the button again. Cards when you are finished playing.

294
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Put them all in a red box, shuffle them using the lever on the table, and after a few seconds, press the lever.

295
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,200
Turn it off and turn on the lever on the right for about 5 seconds.The deck is out and no cards come out.

296
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,159
Hahahaha Even if the foot lamp in front of you is out, use any procedure to return the card to the deck.

Is it okay to press the middle button three times?

315
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,160
1223 Are you coming here?

316
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,960
Oh here it is

317
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,560
is 2 pairs 2 pairs

318
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,560
Desu pair

319
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,680
Yay!

320
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,440
My brother's guardian is this

321
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:11,960
Hey, it's here. It's interesting.

322
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,119
No matter what, this is my victory

323
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,240
It's my victory. Four people can do this.

324
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
is

325
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,839
When you're done, break it up and give it back.

326
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,599
Put it in when finished

327
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,640
After a few seconds, turn off the lever and press the right lever.

328
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Put 12345

329
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,680
Well, which one?

330
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,720
Shuffle left here

331
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:17,119
After a few seconds of shuffling, turn off the lever and press the right lever for 5 seconds.

332
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,560
Moderate

333
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:31,599
1345 This is the end. This is really interesting. What a genius.

334
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:41,640
Wow, everyone made 1234 games in one week. So far, it's amazing.

335
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,640
I'm looking forward to it. I've made 4 games in a week. That's awesome.

336
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,480
I'll probably do it at an RPG school or something.

337
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:01,400
This Minecraft game is more difficult than this, with its crazy ceilings and complicated work.

338
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,359
too fast

339
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:10,400
Oh ghost, ghost

340
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:20,319
Okay, let's go to the introduction corner. Wait a minute, before that.

341
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:29,359
Let's go take a look at the foundation of the digital circus I created last week.

342
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:35,440
Another listener took over, check it out.

343
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,800
Let's go, the roof is done. I only did the foundation and walls.

344
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:51,720
But I was looking forward to it.Wait, I'm making both sides too.

345
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,520
Are you going to see Janja?

346
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,280
Wow, you did a great job on the ceiling.

347
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,560
I was the only one who could use World Edit on the walls, so I did that, but the ceiling was also pokopoko by myself.

348
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,599
You did it, you did it in one week, it's amazing

349
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:28,680
Wait, Rhett too.

350
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:35,560
The reproducibility is too high

351
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:43,760
This is the world and this is the exit.

352
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,760
and

353
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:57,480
That's amazing, but it probably means I can go left and right.

354
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,520
I didn't expect this to mean that a room was created in this position.

355
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,319
Did you make a room?

356
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:19,040
It's so thin, it's so amazing, it's serious, each and every one of us should make it properly

357
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:28,359
I wonder where it is?

358
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,760
Oh there's a bug

359
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:44,960
That's amazing, I used Ed crystal to express the eyes.

360
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:53,800
Kae: I guess this other room was made based on a prediction.

361
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:00,319
Maybe you predicted all of this.

362
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,880
Amazing reproducibility

363
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,880
Sugiyabai stage and other things

364
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,960
Naza Amazing Digital

365
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:23,240
The circus is crazy, I'm glad I left it to this.

366
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,760
This is the last scene, where the mouth is limp.

367
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,800
This is the scene where Neguchi is squishy. Now, sit down.

368
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,319
[Music] Wow, this is the best YouTube

369
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,960
If you search for The Amazing Digital Circus, you'll see 3D animation now.

370
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,440
That's amazing, it's been played about 100 million times in 3 weeks.

371
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,000
But it's a mix of cute anime and a bit of Back Rooms and SCP.

372
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,319
It's a creepy work with horror elements, but my listeners probably all

373
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,680
I love it, it's amazing, I want you to make that too.

374
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,119
Beyond my exit, beyond my exit

375
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,839
Please come this way and connect to the entrance here.

376
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:30,960
Well, that's what I was trying to do.

377
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:40,680
Wait there, connect from around here, do your best, and I'll help too.

378
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,079
But let's try our best to connect until we get to that circus.

379
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,599
Ma told me about that office, so I looked at it and it was amazing.

380
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:58,319
It was interesting, it was interesting, and it looked good. I thought everyone would like it.

381
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,960
But I'll do my best to connect this place.It's like this.

382
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,599
If there's a place you can go to, like a furnace, let's connect.

383
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,200
No, I understand that the work is really hard.

384
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,160
Okay, now it's time for digestion.

385
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:39,760
Well, I've just been looking through it, and I wonder if there's anything new.

386
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,480
Well, there's actually something here.

387
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,760
Come on.

388
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:57,839
Give it to me, this is a circus. Oh yeah, it's probably a circus.

389
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,920
It's all white, so why don't you take me with you?

390
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,599
Not good

391
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,160
There's a pool at that hotel.

392
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,119
Tokoro Tsuki

393
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:28,559
I'm climbing up the sky, but

394
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,240
Climb, climb, new successes, are they increasing?

395
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:41,599
Mart is good, the number of successful marts has increased tremendously.

396
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,640
Terua Hotel

397
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,680
Where is this top?

398
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,400
I didn't see it

399
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,040
When you think of a hotel, you think of a pool.

400
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,359
Isn't that right?

401
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,480
I won't fall into the safety pool ahead.

402
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:24,880
Oh, I won't forget that a falling accident happened. Someone disappeared.

403
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,559
It's a pool. What's this?

404
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,440
Gachipur

405
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,280
This is good

406
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,960
There's something a little scary about that, like a Jizo statue.

407
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,880
The pool is full of suspiciousness [music]

408
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,720
Why is the back side blocked like this?

409
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,880
No, it's bigger

410
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:14,640
I want a pool.If I can build something like this, it's something like that.

411
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:23,760
What do you call it, not Summer Jumbo? It's a big one for kids.

412
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,720
Anywhere in the pool?

413
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,359
I don't want space, but there's more than you might think.

414
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,800
Let's make the next one

415
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:49,680
Summerland, yes, Summerland-like Summer-Summer Jumbo is that.

416
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:57,800
It's a lottery. Maybe it's gone.

417
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:06,280
I'm sure you're here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm sure it's the end

418
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,640
You're an SCP person, right? The SCP Foundation isn't here yet.

419
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,119
I think there's still something

420
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,079
Dako Nakaa Museum of Art has new exhibits at Okeo

421
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:33,400
Okay ah, I'm here. Everyone is looking for people who want to make it. Behind the scenes.

422
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,960
Connect the hallways and make it as you like. Make this everyone.

423
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:48,160
Please, this foundation facility was expanded and advertised. Thank you, I don't understand.

424
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,920
But it would certainly be better to put more signboards around here instead of over there.

425
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:01,079
I guess it was good, I guess so too.

426
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:08,480
Let's build it If you are confident, expand the SCP foundation facilities.

427
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,079
Let's advertise it.

428
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,160
The next person

429
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,359
Go ahead, that big building you just saw.

430
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,960
Ai Aretsuki

431
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,960
Tekouun

432
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,319
That pole dance

433
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:54,440
I didn't see anyone here tomorrow.

434
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:02,280
I feel like I've seen a lot of them

435
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:11,119
This is scary BGM and I saw this voice.

436
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,400
I didn't introduce piano streaming.

437
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:27,200
The atmosphere here, where Keko is tied to a mysterious chest, is really nice.

438
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,040
No, I'm going to get off if something happens.

439
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,599
I haven't introduced you.

440
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,720
Takore

441
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:52,599
[Music] has never been like this before.

442
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:59,680
Well, I guess I saw it by myself. It's amazing.

443
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:08,079
Hey, I love mysterious spaces like this, so that's why I'm watching this.

444
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:16,599
I made that, oh thank you. Look at this, I copied it too.

445
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,960
I thought so and made it

446
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,440
What I made next is

447
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,520
[Music] Where is that?

448
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:44,440
But wait a minute.

449
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,720
This is it

450
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:57,400
Hey, when I look at that space, I try to imitate the pure white sky and red.

451
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,079
I made a door

452
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:13,839
It's like cyberpunk, right? [Music]

453
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:22,070
Alright then, next [music]

454
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:33,160
The BGM plays something like how many different Minecraft songs are there?

455
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:45,799
Surprisingly, there is no referral tax today.You are the person who introduces me.

456
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,079
It looks like it's different [music]

457
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:57,359
Introducing

458
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,160
I'm not the creator, but it looks like a huge castle behind the back wall of the Chinese building.

459
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,680
That's right. How do we get there? Shall we go?

460
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:17,359
Na

461
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:27,280
There are a lot of people over there who are still working on it.

462
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:34,030
[Music] What's up there, that UFO?

463
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:40,319
[Music] Kakore

464
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:49,319
A row of heads coming from a cat

465
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:57,680
But what is the concept behind this UFO?

466
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,079
Amazing where did it come in?

467
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:11,000
The octopus's alien head is glowing

468
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:20,720
But the concept of this and that is a mystery

469
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,880
good length

470
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:38,640
Nekyaku is also the creator, but there is a mini story, so I'll show you after the museum if you'd like.

471
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,960
I think it's hard to understand in the comments, but you said something about Asoka Art Museum.

472
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:51,160
Look at that alien concept thing.

473
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,160
from

474
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,839
I see

475
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:14,440
It looks like you, so I just made it. I see.

476
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,960
The guys on the top are kind of cute

477
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:29,599
Even in UF, there are a lot of Kim Mirai types at the top.

478
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,960
happy

479
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,160
Hey, it's this big!

480
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:49,160
It was hard to understand the sense of art at first.

481
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,559
increased in rank

482
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,079
Apparently now

483
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,040
special room for lambs

484
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,200
Oh, you can donate money here too.

485
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:21,319
Yes, I saw this.November 9, 2023, in the unnamed exhibition room.

486
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:27,520
Toka's body was found and the investigation revealed it and it became a hot topic.

487
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:36,720
Try to understand the feelings that led this small artist to leave Renomu in the exhibition room. Disposal of Kagami's body.

488
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,680
We decided to preserve the situation at that time with a replica of Gomoji's old age.

489
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,480
Because the situation is a delicate one, such as the death of someone who has died, the interference may cause discomfort to the person being interfered with.

490
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:56,039
Although there is a possibility, I would appreciate it if you could use it.

491
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:03,280
The Kuron Foundation has established a private fund to prevent similar areas from occurring in the future.

492
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:12,039
We are accepting donations at the same time in the fight box on the right. Regarding the authority of this matter,

493
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,760
Moreover, it is published on Mei's YouTube channel.

494
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,760
ah

495
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,640
Thank you, I'll put some money in.30

496
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:34,720
Coins have also increased separately from this.

497
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,960
Right, this is what I saw in my dream.

498
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,960
room

499
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:53,880
I never thought my name would appear in my dreams, this or that, or that child's room.

500
00:56:53,880 --> 00:57:01,920
No switch child eh

501
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,440
No way

502
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:15,119
Itâs so amazing, how did you express it like this?

503
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,440
That's really good Po

504
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:28,480
Even Nico is sure of this too.Press the switch and it will be confirmed.

505
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:34,240
Well, the windows are nice too, but it's kind of creepy.

506
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,400
And I was scared even in my dreams

507
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:52,960
Others are sheep

508
00:57:53,799 --> 00:58:02,599
It's not done yet. Someone can make it for me.

509
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:08,640
This is a mystery.

510
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,720
amazing

511
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:18,280
I feel like going home

512
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:26,359
Masuhai

513
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:32,839
Actually, there was someone who offered to show me around the church, so I guess it's okay.

514
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:43,039
I'll wait, but the bottom part is really crowded.

515
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,039
Na

516
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,240
3, so we can't explore the lower part in one day.

517
00:58:53,240 --> 00:59:02,400
It's so possible that it's truly amazing, so look at your field of vision.

518
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,880
If you do this, you'll end up saying something dangerous, so don't do it.

519
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,079
But at least this much

520
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:17,280
[music]

521
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,640
Oh, the church people

522
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:31,760
I won't know where I am unless you show me around.

523
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:39,200
There was a restaurant right below the museum, and I went to the ruins right below it to hide it.

524
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,720
Please, yes, yes, museum

525
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:49,200
is that or that

526
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,319
The master is around here

527
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:02,400
Where is it like?

528
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,200
Well, you made this well too.

529
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,839
If there are no people who can make a lot of the same thing, the project won't work.

530
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:22,200
Thank you very much for making it all over the wall.

531
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:27,280
Previously this

532
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,520
It's simple, it's amazing, it's quite difficult to make these stairs.

533
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,280
It's a special block so it's really

534
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,680
It's around here even if it's off.

535
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:57,760
Maybe somewhere higher up?

536
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,480
It's on the same wall.

537
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,799
shop

538
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,680
Where is it?

539
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,280
restaurant restaurant

540
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:26,440
It's not like that restaurant.

541
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:37,119
There are ruins at the bottom [music]

542
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,280
I can't find it

543
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,319
No Matsuya ah

544
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:56,839
This is where the art museum is. This is the museum.

545
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:03,720
Hey, this is the place I just saw full of grass.

546
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,760
Or maybe

547
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:26,359
I'm sleepy trying to figure out who's here.

548
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,210
Is this where the bottom grows?

549
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:42,800
[music]

550
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:52,599
The same side, the same side means this or that.

551
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:56,359
Maybe this is it

552
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:10,480
You've already seen this restaurant. You've seen this stylish restaurant.

553
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,559
Takore's

554
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:26,880
This is coming soon

555
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,599
It's a different color

556
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:49,720
I'm not sure what to do

557
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:58,440
I wonder if someone will guide me like that?

558
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,440
I understand

559
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,440
here

560
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:19,160
This, this, this, this.

561
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,200
I'll watch Kaja

562
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,200
picture

563
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:36,319
Yes, you're making something outrageous, what is this?

564
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:46,680
It's Dark Souls, it's Arron.

565
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:53,599
No, the front entrance is so plain that I don't understand it without Ebardet.

566
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,160
hand

567
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:05,039
You did a great job with World Edit.

568
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:15,520
Awesome mini-story: A dilapidated shop hidden in a restaurant

569
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,920
You can watch it first

570
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:26,079
Noisy

571
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,079
A church is like a castle.

572
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,160
Okay, let's see

573
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:45,920
Or the rags hidden in the restaurant under the museum.

574
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:56,079
Okay, let's go. You made something outrageous again.

575
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:59,359
that

576
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,440
This is it [music]

577
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:10,799
This or that restaurant is different from this restaurant.

578
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,680
rags on the verge of

579
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,839
It's probably this one, around here, this one.

580
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,160
What's wrong?

581
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:33,079
I think it's around here.

582
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:39,359
What is this ramen and the ridiculous amount of ramen?

583
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:53,000
It's right below the restaurant.This is the restaurant.This is it.This is definitely this.

584
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,279
da [music]

585
01:06:56,279 --> 01:07:00,039
This is it

586
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:05,960
Oh, it's someone's dead body. This town feels familiar.

587
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,039
Because I'm used to seeing it

588
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:20,880
Hey, something is about to begin again. We've finally arrived here.

589
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:28,359
The relationship with Japan has been deteriorating for several years, but somehow we have managed to share the teachings of our God with the people of this land.

590
01:07:28,359 --> 01:07:35,520
The harshness of the piercing gaze that I want to convey is something that can't be helped for now, so I demand it first.

591
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:41,440
The descendants of those who settled this land when it was once a valid nation.

592
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:48,640
Let's look for it.According to what we've heard, it's said that they're building a magnificent cathedral.

593
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:55,079
There is no such thing as a street where you can't find it, and what is worrying is that legitimate competitions are taking place after the illegal ones.

594
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:03,000
There is a possibility that if I do not correct it, their faith itself will be corrected.

595
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,039
In order to avoid denying the

596
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:15,279
In any case, today the tired military is flying airplanes, but eventually

597
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:22,839
We civilians will also be able to travel quickly and easily by flying through the sky.

598
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:30,880
Days pass by without a search for my compatriots.

599
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:38,359
The enemy of our country is deep-rooted this time, but we can't find it even if we search for the Cathedral of the Steps.

600
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:47,159
However, when it comes to social activities such as housing contracts and employment, there are walls.

601
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:55,480
I've lost all the money I have, and the ruins I've washed up on are attacked by insects.

602
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:05,159
This town, which is far from peaceful and full of people, is a place where people can settle.

603
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:12,920
It was difficult, yes, yes, it was cheap, but they should be the same, so why are they excluding me?

604
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,080
Karonen's blood seeps into it and it's readable.

605
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,640
I finally met someone who has the blood of my country, but he is also not part of the community of my fellow countrymen.

606
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:31,560
It's sad that he doesn't seem to understand, but I respect him for living assimilated into the local community.

607
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:40,799
It's tall or thin, but the clues are impossible to decipher.There's a ramen shop in the neighborhood, but there's a sign on top of it.

608
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:46,679
The angel who seems to have a shop selling snacks and bars is of Japanese descent.

609
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:52,719
Let's visit her tomorrow as she is said to be the face of our company.

610
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:59,320
Although she was able to contact Oni Angel, she was only a community of descendants of early settlers.

611
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:07,280
He seems to think of him as a member of the group, but he gave me hints about how many times he met the giant with a large mouth under the bridge of the dragon.

612
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,800
Thank you for everything you look at

613
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:17,760
Oh man, even when I look back at the sentences I wrote down, there's no meaning to them.

614
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,640
Speaking of unknown dragons, I remember seeing a giant face intact.

615
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:31,080
I arrived quickly, but the inside of the cathedral was filled with an eerie silence, with no sign of anyone.

616
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:38,000
Considering the relationship between the two countries, what was hidden in such a place was being suppressed.

617
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,960
After returning home, I remembered that in many cases, cathedrals have an underground section.

618
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:51,920
He may have been hiding in the basement and praying, just like my uncle used to do.

619
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:59,199
In addition to distracting myself by converting the feelings that cannot be described as anger or sadness into words, which I feel as if my pen is heavy.

620
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:07,360
It is a common story all over the world that local gatherings and beliefs change as a result, and I am fully aware of this as well.

621
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,960
I knew this, but this is too much of an evil thing.

622
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:19,640
It's my struggle with God, it's a problem before that, and I'm satisfied with words like differences in ideology.

623
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:27,120
Maybe someday they'll find a good victim. What about the sheep?

624
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,600
I don't think he wants to be told something he doesn't understand.

625
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:38,679
Yeah, there's a field of vision behind the white rose underground

626
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:42,080
red

627
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:47,639
Well, first of all, I found this just because it's Hirie.

628
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:49,760
Na

629
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,239
Probably probably

630
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:03,639
But the dragon

631
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:13,719
A giant with a big mouth The giant stares at the tip

632
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:16,719
of

633
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,719
Hirie, I cheated and found it.

634
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:28,920
A church that I couldn't find for a long time when it was here.

635
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,679
was here

636
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:41,360
What an amazing place

637
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,880
Or underground, or underground.

638
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:55,000
There's nothing like the entrance.

639
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,360
white

640
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:02,440
Here's what's weird

641
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,480
Somehow I can go

642
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:19,199
Behind the scenes, solve the mystery

643
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:24,400
Let's look for it, everyone.

644
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,880
No, it's a big deal, so don't fly away

645
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:33,920
Let's look for the giant with a big mouth

646
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,880
That's Mr.

647
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:47,000
First of all, go upstairs

648
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,360
Let's see it

649
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,719
Okay

650
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,679
Amakou

651
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:25,280
It wasn't Katoomoore.

652
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:34,840
There's got to be an underground entrance somewhere, but finding it is the fun part.

653
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,880
No, it's amazing, really

654
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:51,880
Kanaeko is amazing from the inside.

655
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:57,239
Not a great decoration

656
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:03,700
What's amazing? [Music]

657
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:19,880
Should I read that again? I brought a book, please.

658
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:26,800
I guess that's true. There's no other way than that. Wait a minute.

659
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:33,040
Teroe didn't give me any hints.

660
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,520
That's what I said

661
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:44,679
Hint, this time I'll search by myself

662
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:55,080
I'm going to borrow a little bit of this book, that punishment.

663
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:00,239
If you roll your mouse hard enough, you can copy it.

664
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,040
From hobby

665
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,679
While looking at Takore

666
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
let's do it

667
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:25,800
Well, I already found this somewhere in town.

668
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:37,080
Even if you say that the underground system is being destroyed, I don't think there are any hints about the underground.

669
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:42,400
A white rose behind a white rose

670
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,000
The white background

671
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:52,080
Let's look for this, isn't this?

672
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:59,600
No, it's a flower after all. Let's look for a flower. This is probably this.

673
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,679
It's here, white

674
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:21,400
Rose, white flower

675
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,360
Ha, this is also a white rose.

676
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,120
There was, there was, there was, there was, there was, there was.

677
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,440
Where did this open?

678
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,239
And the other side too

679
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
be

680
01:17:55,639 --> 01:18:01,520
Isn't this all or this something opened?

681
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:10,480
Kaa

682
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,080
It's amazingly good

683
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,149
[music]

684
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,920
cormorant

685
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,920
I'm praying here

686
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,120
Ta

687
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:45,159
So what were you doing when your vision was red?

688
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:54,920
Okay, but unlike the other statues, the color is darker.

689
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:06,880
It was horror, but there was an ax [music]

690
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:13,320
It looks similar to the sheep room. Was it the same ritual?

691
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:20,960
Wow, that's amazing. There's nothing else like it.

692
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:27,100
There's nothing else hidden [music]

693
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,440
You made a good space

694
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,320
That's all.

695
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:50,600
Thank you, this is seriously amazing. This gimmick is also amazing.

696
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,800
It's closed. It's closed.

697
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,920
Teru

698
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,679
Okay

699
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:12,800
Okay, let's add a shadow at the end.

700
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,719
Also include shadows

701
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:27,520
I guess I'll just look around and call it a day. I'm really going to do a lot of things in a week, everyone.

702
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:34,080
Seriously, I can't even open the selfie box.

703
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,480
Ta

704
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:49,719
There are too many producers, so if anyone sees this stream and wants to make something, please see the summary below.

705
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:53,400
I'll send you the ID from Google Hoom in the column.

706
01:20:53,400 --> 01:21:00,080
If you send me your bad ID, I will add it to the whitelist. Thank you.

707
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,400
If someone can't get in even though I sent them their ID, it's probably

708
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:13,440
There is a possibility that that ID is different, so please be sure to send your Minecraft ID.

709
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:18,120
Please, it's amazing! White [Music]

710
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:24,280
This is nice and done properly

711
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:29,360
It's really cool and amazing

712
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,440
It's seriously amazing

713
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:45,679
With this, everyone, I will end this article here.

714
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:53,800
Eh, the difference between Minecraft and Minecraft will be one month next week. Just because it's one month doesn't mean we're going to do anything.

715
01:21:53,800 --> 01:22:00,760
I'll probably introduce it again soon, but from now on, I'll be able to take advantage of my free time and introduce my favorite architecture.

716
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:06,719
If you could actually build it with due consideration to the surrounding buildings.

717
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,000
I don't care what kind of architecture you want, so I'd appreciate your help.

718
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:18,760
Me too, I log in every day and create something, so I'm just going to chat.

719
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:24,159
I can't respond outside of the broadcast, so please only respond there.

720
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:30,400
With that in mind, I would like to end today with this.

721
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:36,440
Thank you to the person who introduced me and the person who always makes it.

722
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:44,199
Thank you very much, please respect your manners. I'm very happy. So, tomorrow.

723
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:52,000
It's a ghost photo. I'd like to see a ghost photo for the first time in a while. See you again tonight.

724
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,199
Thank you for your hard work
