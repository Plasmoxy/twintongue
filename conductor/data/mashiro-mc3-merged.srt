こんばんは今日はマイクラ
Good evening, today is Minecraft

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,880
ですやばいここ最近毎日おでんしか食べてない
It's so bad, I've only been eating oden every day lately.

10
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,000
わ今日はセブン
Wow today is seven

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,799
のおでんでコとチア卵
oden deko and chia egg

12
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,479
だけえチアブってあのちくわじゃないんだ
Only Chiabu is not that Chikuwa.

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,599
ねちくわブってあれ何
What is Nechikuwabu?

14
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,200
持ちなべちゃべちゃしてるやつはいなんなん
What kind of person is talking about holding a pot?

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,360
だじゃ白くてもちもちしてる伝聞みたい
It's white and sticky, like hearsay.

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,800
なブですよ何ブってごめんいや知ら
It's Nabu. I'm sorry, I don't know what Bu is.

17
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,400
ないいやでも
No, no, but

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,720
ねちょおでんの話じゃないんだけど僕普段からうつ伏せでしか寝れないっ
I'm not talking about Nechooden, but I usually only sleep on my stomach.

19
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,440
て言ってたじゃん今日頑張ってね初めてえ多分なんかちゃんと仰向けで寝ようと
That's what I said. Good luck today. It's probably my first time trying to sleep properly on my back.

20
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,920
思って寝れたの初めてだよな今日みんな仰向けはいい
It's the first time I've been able to sleep with this in mind. It's okay for everyone to lie on their backs today.

21
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,560
ぞすごいね寝るの大変だったんだけど頑張って仰向けで寝てみたらなん
It was amazing. It was hard to sleep, but I tried my best to sleep on my back.

22
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,720
と寝起きがめちゃくちゃ良くて
And I wake up feeling really good.

23
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:31,120
かつ悪夢を見なかった夢見る時絶対悪魔見るんだよ
And I never had nightmares. When I dream, I definitely see demons.

24
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,239
どんな日でも悪夢を見てきたんだけど今日はね悪夢じゃなかっ
I've had nightmares on any given day, but today is not a nightmare.

25
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:44,680
た何の夢を見たか覚えてないけどいやちょっと頑張ってこれから仰向き
I don't remember what I dreamed about, but I'll do my best and turn around from now on.

26
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,439
で寝ようと思った
I thought about sleeping in

27
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,280
ねいや多分ねそうなんか寝を関係あるらしいうつ伏せはね悪夢を見やすいんだっ
Well, I guess it has something to do with sleeping. Lying on your stomach makes you more likely to have nightmares.

28
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,760
てそ聞いたポケモンスリープやってるやってるよ今はねイーブとゴースの厳選をし
I heard that I'm playing Pokemon Sleep, and right now I'm making a selection of Eve and Gorse.

29
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,120
てる全然終わんない厳選
A selection that never ends

30
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,519
があとすやすやが出
Later, Yasuya appears.

31
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,199
ないなんかポケモンスリープってうとうとすやすやぐっすりのなんか3種類に分け
Pokemon sleep is divided into three types: nap, sleep, and sound sleep.

32
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:26,199
られるんだけど寝てるパターンが大体ぐっすりかウトウですやすやがマジで出
I can do it, but most of the time I'm sleeping soundly or dozing off.

33
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,240
ないんだよどうやったら出るんだよすやすや
It's not there, how can I get it out?

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,479
そうだから僕炎タイプのポケモン捕まえられないんだ
That's why I can't catch fire type Pokemon.

35
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:44,600
よポケモンスリープ厳やるなんか性格とかスキル厳選があってそれによって全然ね
There's a strict selection of personalities and skills for Pokemon Sleep, and it all depends on that.

36
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,160
ポイントが違うんだよでポイントが高ければ高いほどやっぱレアなポケモンとかも出
The points are different, so the higher the points, the rarer Pokemon you can get.

37
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,120
やすくなるところに行けるし結構ね深いんですよポケモンスイープ
You can go to places where it gets easier, and it's pretty deep.Pokémon Sweep

38
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,919
はやっと21レベになったほお僕はね37レベだよポケモン
I finally reached level 21. I'm a level 37 Pokemon.

39
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,840
スリープガチ勢だからとりあえずねポケモンスリープ初めの
I'm a big fan of sleep, so this is my first time using Pokemon Sleep.

40
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:19,080
人はねみんなイブじゃなくてあのバタフリーを厳選するといい
I think people should choose Butterfree instead of Eve.

41
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,960
よバタフリーマジ最強だから僕最初の頃はバタフリー2体構成にし
Yo Butterfree is seriously the strongest, so when I first started, I had two Butterfrees.

42
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:34,000
てたよバタフリー2体とゴルダックとライチュとあとウィンディがね
There were two Butterfrees, Golduck, Raichu, and Windy.

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,120
最強どこの攻略サイトにも載ってないけどウィンディマジで
It's not listed on any strategy site, but it's Windy Maji.

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,240
最強ウィンディは普通ですみたいなところ結構見るんだけど僕的にねウィンディ多分
I see a lot of people saying that the strongest Windy is normal, but for me, Windy is probably the best.

45
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,319
ねティアゼティアSです1番
Netia Zetia S number 1

46
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,400
上ウィンディってスキルが他のポケモンにお手伝いするっていう効果なんだ
Upper Windy is a skill that helps other Pokemon.

47
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,479
けどそれがねマジで
But that's serious

48
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,479
最強まあまあまあということで今日はマイクラです
The strongest is so-so, so today it's Minecraft.

49
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:18,800
さてじゃ最初に企画の説明をするとえこのリスナー参加型の企画こちら僕が
Well, first of all, let me explain the project.Eko's listener participation type project.This is me.

50
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:27,280
用意したねこの真四角の土台の中に好きなように建築をしようっていう企画
A plan to build anything you like inside the cat's square base that you have prepared.

51
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:39,080
で今週で3周目になりましたさあどこまで行ったでしょうか見ていき
So it's my third week this week, so let's see how far I've come.

52
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,360
ましょうおいということで
Because it's Mashooi

53
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:55,720
ください僕のお花お花屋さんができましたそう僕もなんだかんだでね毎日ログイン
Please give me flowers. I've opened a flower shop. That's why I log in every day.

54
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,360
してちょこちょこと作ってはいるんです
I've been making it from time to time.

55
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,680
よこですねもこの隣の建築パクったんだけど完全に丸パクりです
Yoko Nene also copied the building next door, but it's a complete copy.

56
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,840
ねこのお魚屋さんの隣にお花屋さんを勝手に作りまし
I built a flower shop next to the cat's fish shop without permission.

57
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,400
たこれめっちゃいいブロックじゃないなんかいおしゃれなお店に使えるなと思っ
This is a really nice block, but I think it could be used for a stylish shop.

58
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,400
てやってみたこれガチおしゃれおしゃれブロだ
This is a seriously stylish blog.

59
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:39,199
よこれ僕の理想のねお花屋さんですなかなかいい
This is my ideal flower shop.It's really nice.

60
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,400
でしょということでさて全体的に見た
So, let's look at it as a whole.

61
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,360
けど変わったところもうだいぶなんかみんなね作れるところないなって状態に
But what has changed is that there is no longer a place where everyone can make it.

62
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,639
なってるでしょもう上とか作っていいからね本当に隙間を全部ね埋めるようにして
I see, you can just make the top part, just make sure to fill in all the gaps.

63
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,560
欲しいんだよ僕ははということであもあれ壊そうと思ってん
I want it, and I'm thinking of destroying it all.

64
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:13,080
だけど適当に作ってましたでも壊しますあれあのでかいトンネルね作ったんだけど
But I made it randomly, but I'm going to destroy it.That's that huge tunnel I made.

65
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:21,000
使い道がマジで思い浮かばないそう裏裏ルートが多すぎてじゃぱっと
I seriously can't think of a use for it, there are so many hidden routes.

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,080
見なんか増えたなみたいなところを見ていくかあいいねなんか本当にね隙間を埋め
If you look at the places where the number of people watching has increased, I really like it.Fill in the gaps.

67
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,240
て欲しいんだよこんな感じに
I want it like this

68
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,240
とか
And

69
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,399
おおいやこれ楽しみにしてたんだよなまだできてないなこれやばく
Oh man, I was looking forward to this. It's not done yet. This is terrible.

70
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:51,560
ない多分SCPの施設だと思うけど財団これマジで
No, I think it's probably an SCP facility, but the Foundation is serious about this.

71
00:08:51,560 --> 00:09:01,200
やばいあでもなんかだいぶできてきてるエンチャント部屋だ
This is an enchanted room that's starting to look pretty good.

72
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,279
だいぶなんかできてきてるよねあ
Something is starting to get done quite a bit.

73
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,680
そうこおおこれ
That's right, this is it

74
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120

75

だこれはおいいね
This is so nice

76
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,800

You really worked hard on the stairs.

77
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,959
でここ

Wow, this is a containment breach. It's seriously a containment breach. I'm calling B here.

What is it being used for?

85
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,519

I'm looking forward to seeing you there.There's a reference room here and there.

86
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,040
ブロックあったんだこれパロこれマジですごいわ
There was a block, this is paro, this is seriously amazing

87
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:38,160
これ影モなしでこれだからねもこのサーバーね影も入れると
This is without a shadow, so this is also this server, and if you add a shadow,

88
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,200
めちゃくちゃ重くなるレベルにブロックの量が多くなってしまったからお君が作った
You made it because the amount of blocks had increased to the point where it was extremely heavy.

89
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,600
のかちょ上の階見に行ってみていい
You can go check out Kacho's upper floor.

90
00:10:52,200 --> 00:11:00,240
かガチ作り込まれてるおおこっからかえ
It's so well made it's a big deal

91
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:09,560
えすごいななんか全部同じ感じじゃなくて1つ1つの部屋こだわりが
What's amazing is that not all rooms have the same feel, but each room has its own unique feel.

92
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,040
感じる案内して
Guide me by feeling

93

97
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,360
すげえんなんかもらったけど拾えなかったな多分
I got something amazing, but I probably couldn't pick it up.

98
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,639
下の床のブロックだろう
It's probably a block on the floor below.

99
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,839
なほんで

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240

112
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,320
で見ようあれだってバックルームズでしょバックルームズもなんか日々拡大されてる
Let's take a look at that. It's the Back Rooms, right? The Back Rooms are also expanding day by day.

113
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,760
んだよどんどん広がっ
It's spreading more and more

114

What's above

115
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,079
だ富年みたいなのができてるすごすぎるあここら辺も
It's amazing that things like Futoshi are being built here and there.

116
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,839
ねなるほどなるほど
It makes me sleepy

117
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,959
いや楽しみだなここもま他パッと見の
I'm really looking forward to this and other things at a glance.

118
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,760
ところこれなんかできてん
However, I haven't been able to do anything like this.

119
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,279
なあまだ伝説途中かな
I guess it's still a legend

120
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,000
いやなんかもうできてるすごい庭園みたいになっ
No, it looks like an amazing garden that has already been built.

121
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,759
てる声1人でやってんのかなやばいなマジ
I wonder if he's doing it by himself. It's really scary.

122
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:24,399
でよすなんか見てしまったまた別のとんでもないの見てしまったちょっと後で
I saw something like Deyosu.A little while after I saw another outrageous thing.

123
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,800
見に行こうあれもはあ
Let's go see it too
