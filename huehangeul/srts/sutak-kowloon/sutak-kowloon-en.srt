00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,400
Now, this time the game is Welcome to Korun Kowloon

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,820
It's a new horror game on Steam called Welcome. The price of the game is

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,440
It is 7,800 won. I will proceed with the rabbit's Korean patch.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,859
The story of this game is that you go to Kowloon to find cheap housing.

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,699
The residents here look like normal people at first glance.

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,960
But if you dig deeper, you will see their true face.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,780
Well then, I'll try it right away

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,340
Kowloon Walled City 199 years

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,260
Beneath the foggy Chinese city of Cannes is the most populous city, poverty and

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,280
It is home to Kowloon, a city with rampant gang violence.

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:00,489
[music]

12
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,720
However, for young students, finding a cheap room is the first priority.

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,140
It's urgent.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,020
But I guess it's a real place

15
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,680
good mood

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,000
What awaits him within the walls of the city

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,299
Now, I'm in the building. The quality is quite good.

18
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,020
I made it very well

19
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,560
let's go

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,040
where is my house

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,939
I hear some people

22
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,000
what party are you having

23
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,860
The quality is really good

24
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,659
[Music] Is this my home

25
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,560
I don't think it's here

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,060
is there anything

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,680
Yeah, somehow it seems like here, but it doesn't seem to be here either.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,040
where does the sound of the song come from

29
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,220
It's locked, do you need a key or something?

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,739
Is this place open?

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,800
It looks like a ghost will come out

32
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,019
What is the price of a house here

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,099
I'm on the 4th floor for tens of thousands of won.

34
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,379
Something's on fire

35
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,940
There is no information about the number of floors here

36
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,620
Something, but the atmosphere is like this for a moment. You can just go in.

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,640
looks like a small pelvis

38
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,000
the atmosphere is eerie

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,260
I'll have to look around next time

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,800
The wound is blocked here too

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,340
look where the dog is

42
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,900
Oh, it seems like a ghost will come out. What are you talking about?

43
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,200
what's the doorbell sound

44
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,099
What is the puppy doing here

45
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,299
I feel sorry for him. He looks hungry.

46
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,200
there's nothing to eat

47
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,159
It's dark. It's locked.

48
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,099
what is this

49
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,760
It smells so bad

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,139
this is the garbage dump

51
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,520
There's a door, but there's garbage like this

52
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,250
Take care, I'll buy you something to eat later

53

[music]

54
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,340
why is it so dark

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,860
can i go here

56
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:58,280
It seems like this is a place like power

57
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,880
it's okay

58
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,479
Why is this place blocked like this so I can't enter?

59
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,800
going up

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
The road is blocked

61
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,460
bug sounds

62
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,139
What do we do

63
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,419
this is it

64
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,220
As soon as you open this, it's not a house again, it's a hallway again

65
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,340
yes

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
what are you talking about

67
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,000
did you hear wrong

68
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,300
who is crying

69
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,440
who are you

70
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,160
the cries are gone

71
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,080
Is this place gone? Oh, I left the key at the store. It will be outside the entrance.

72
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,900
What are you talking about?

73
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm not talking about this entrance outside wearing it, no way

74
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,139
Are you wearing a building and talking? I left it to the store.

75
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,139
while going back

76
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,319
I heard a sound again

77
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,419
let's go down

78
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,120
Hey, why did you get your energy back?

79
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,300
I'm not

80
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,840
Right

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,319
don't think like that

82
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,560
what did you just see

83
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,680
here earlier

84
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,740
there was something

[music]

86
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:36,599
No, just now, a person was extending his arms like this and then he disappeared like this.

87
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,060
what is this

88
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,060
let's go out

89
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,180
came out

90
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,180
It seems to be a bit noisier than before.

Stay [Music]

92
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,819
It seems to be the store written in the landlord's writing

93
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,020
The key must be here somewhere, uh dog food

94
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,560
Uh, I can take care of the food, I guess I can give it to you

95
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,320
But you can steal it like this. Let's find the key.

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,500
I got it

99
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,919
Let's go out

100
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,540

102
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,760
What is it, I was surprised. No, suddenly the song

103
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,060
I heard noise as it cut off, but I was too immersed.

104
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,220
what did you just do

105
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:16,140
Well, I came back. I took the key and we

106
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:23,640
I also packed some food for the puppy. Really, donâ€™t do that.

107
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm surprised what is this

108
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
What

109
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,320
Because the building is old

110
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,779

In case you don't know, let's look around one more time

115
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,779
this place was originally

116
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,940
How could I have opened the door like this?

117
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,959
Haven't you seen it before?

118
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,880
can i come in here

119
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,720
Oh, shouldn't I go

120
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm getting close to something, so I can hear the sound

121
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,320
It's like going over something for the first time

122
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,980
You can hear people, it's nothing

What is it? No, the way up was blocked in the first place.

128
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:43,519

168
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,779
Uh, did it originally open like this?

169
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,839
now open

170
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,980
I'm scared of something, I want to go home, but the landlord

171
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,680
I think grandma is crazy. She hasn't been out for a long time.

172
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,930
[music]

173
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,160
what are you talking about here

174
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:25,880
No way, but you better check the front door just in case

175
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,760
[MUSIC] How to check

176
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,559
[music]

177
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,839

178
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,320
can't stand it here

179
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,760
Hey, I really couldn't go out, but the road was blocked.

180
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,920
[Music] How

181
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,920

183
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,020

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,969
[music]

186
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,419
The One You Just Saw [Music]

187
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,540
Shh

188
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,040
Grandma was looking at me

189
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,299
[Music] Hey

190
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,789
[music]

191
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,480
Don't go out recklessly at night

192
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:49,020
Hey, I need to find an exit right now, no, what is it, grandma?

193
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,700
[MUSIC] How do I do it

194
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,460
[music]

195
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,600
Why is this happening? Something is strange everywhere right now

196
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,559
Ask yourself why [music]

197
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,580
The door opened like this, and now I can hear a sound from the comic room.

198
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:29,849
[music]

199
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,179
anybody home

200
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,480
Did you go to the shower now grandma [music]

201
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,980
Now is the time to find something

202
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,860
It was a big deal knowing this is crazy here

203
00:18:46,860 --> 00:19:07,100
Gotta get out soon [Music]

204
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,160

205
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,080
Prepare your mind, don't be surprised

206
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,329
[music]

207
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,070
slowly slowly

208
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,709
[music]

209
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,590
[music]

210
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,349
[music]

211
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,119
[music]

212
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,299
how do i do it [music]

213
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,660
how

214
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,880
not [music]

215
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,000
[MUSIC] How do I do it

216
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,499
can't [music]

217
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,960
wait for a sec

218
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,940
[Music] What can I do?

219
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,240
big trouble

220
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,150
[music]

221
00:20:49,130 --> 00:21:07,509
[music]

222
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,160
What is it that I got caught?

223
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,600
Oh my, oh my

224
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,679
Oh my, oh my

225
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,860
it's a big deal

226
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,900
what

227
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,559
Why does the door only open this way

228
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,159
You want me to look at this

229
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,880
Oh really

230
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,900
how is this

231
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,659
Is there such a thing as a flashlight? It's too dark

232
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,340
Do some research around

233
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,760
Heck, it's open. I think the key is here. I got it earlier.

234
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,780
I'm here

235
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,840
uh where are you

236
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,480
The situation in the village is strange these days. It seems like I am in danger.

237
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,500
I'm going to move soon after I'm done

238
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,480
who is this

239
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,419
Oh why

240
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,880
what are you talking about

241
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,320
anybody home

242
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,840
what

243
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
What

244
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,500
what the hell

245
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,240
Why does the refrigerator door keep opening and closing?

246
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,080
I can't see you because it's dark

247
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,820
now go in here

248
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,400
can key key

249
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,760
Oh, I hate turning back

250
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,840
just saw

251
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:38,900
It wasn't KakaoTalk that stood out because someone made everyone stare

252
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,539
But where is the key

253
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,159
I guess it's here

254
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,480
It's a lock, but I think it's in the form of a password

255
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,760
this is over

256
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,299
now we

257
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,200
I don't know

258
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,320
What else should I know

259
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,309
[music]

260
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:36,200
Be careful with KakaoTalk from the beginning

261
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,659
Oh surprise

262
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,840
Middle C, like C in the middle

263
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:55,740
If you turn this around, where is the middle of the field?

264
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,220
there will be oxygen

265
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,440
Oh this too

266
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,220
I just came

267
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,580
no big deal

268
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,720
Yes, the pictures are single line

269
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,700
Mr. Ddaeng Lee Ddaeng Lee

270
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,679
I need to find the paintings of Mr.

271
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,840
ah

272
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,500
Ding CA Ding eca

273
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,899
If you find the first one

274
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:48,380
please remember

275
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:55,159
ok last one

276
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,880
want to have one here

277
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,039
Where is the cover

278
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
sound

279
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:47,000
No, but I need to find the last picture.

280
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:53,760
But in here, I'm painting

281
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,360
He said the lock didn't click earlier.

282
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,140
Gather all the clues

283
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,080
can proceed

284
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,760
on the bathroom floor

285
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,980
there might be

286
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,679
this is this

287
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,980
substitute d

288
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,339
let's solve

289
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,540
Oh

290
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,460
I left, can I leave now?

291
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,000
Or right

292
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,520
stay apart

293
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,320
Why is the child's corner so scary?

294
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,579
Now, just open it here

295
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,160
I'm here

296
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,140
finally it finally came out

297
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,800
can i go now

298
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,980
I have to go out

299
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,320
I have to go

300
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,760
I have to run away quickly

301
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
hurry

302
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,520
Where did that puppy go earlier?

303
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,800
I gave it to the dog even if it was alive to help me in a crisis situation, but I just wanted it to feel good

304
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,640
event in

305
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,300
Why why why why why why why are you running away all of a sudden

306
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,640
Suddenly they tell me to run away

307
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,000
I don't know where to run, did you run away well now?

308
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,119
Did you run away okay?

309
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,140
There is no way out, password 5913

310
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,560
513

311
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,060
run run run

312
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:06,260
Uh, what's that? It's outside.

313
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
weird

314
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,700
It's the terrain, now that the streets are out, let's find a way to get out of town.

315
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,040
Let's go underground. I don't think it's here.

316
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,700
It looks like hell

317
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,500
here it is

318
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,920
here you come ok please

319
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,119
If you go in here, will you go in there?

320
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,180
No, but the atmosphere here is strange.

321
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,180
What's the atmosphere like here

322
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,400
I think something went wrong, I wasn't here in the first place

323
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,640
what's the phone call

324
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,680
call in there

325
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:45,140
I need to call for help on the phone

326
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,740
What is this? The exit is here

327
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,980
But I need to find something for the string I bought, the bolt cutter

328
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,760
I have an enemy, but I don't have money.

329
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,980
Where did the flashlight go?

330
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,740
What happened yesterday, why suddenly

331
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,079
What is it, the flashlight suddenly disappeared

332
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,280
Do you want to come in here?

333
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,599
scared

334
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,280
Should I find money? Money

335
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,859
die

336
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,079
Elevator does not workThe generator is running out of fuel and the start lever is

337
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,660
It's broken. Should I look for fuel? The lever was earlier.

338
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,380
there was a vending machine

339
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,619

340
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,880

00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:09,619
Oh well, this is easy now

347
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,480

373
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,920
Isn't my hideout beautiful? I wake up my family and the whole village

374
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,000
I've been hiding in this place, avoiding all the terrible things that started, but now

375
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,359
I'm glad there's no one alive in Kowloon. I need that coin.

376
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,599

Go to the vending machine now

00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,500
You can write a coin

382
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,510
What can I do here? Is this a connected place?

383
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,300
[MUSIC] Uh phone

385
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,640
There's no such thing as oil here. Gasoline.

386
00:45:52,650 --> 00:46:09,989
[music]

387
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,579

394
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,579
[Music] Finding Gasoline

395
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,140
There's a person in front of me. If you go closer, it pops out like before.

396
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,839
They might come running screaming, they'll never climb

397

398

are you okay

401
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,790
First of all, Lever, I really hate looking back, please

402
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,960
[music]

403
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:54,260
Why is this sound coming out? The background sound

00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,040
Here

405
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,240
Things are bad. My daughter ran away and I don't know what's wrong.

406
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,900
My wife hasn't gotten out of the bathtub for three days and everyone around me is crazy.

407
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,040
What should I do? I didn't notice it before, but gas is coming out of the gauze.

408
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,319
I think it's all because of him please help

409
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,619
Now, gas comes out of 100 won. It can pop out at any time.

00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,040
gas sound

411
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:48,140
It's ok they're trying to kick us out of town

412
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,380
The government is hiding the fact that we are dying here

413
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,140
here in the gas tank

426
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,099

00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,079
ah what

429
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,339
Once I came out, I won't come back for a while.

430
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,440
He looks like an elevator dog

431
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,119
You're far from the elevator

432
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:40,590

433
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,040

Finally the World Cup

There's no way I could be this calm. What is this atmosphere?

438
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:18,240
[music] I'm going

439
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,740
When the door closes, I'm going to cut it to get out

440
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,850
[music]

441
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,579
Now all you have to do is use the bolt cutters.

442
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,579
It's okay, you just have to move on, there's nothing difficult

443
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:48,450
It's okay if I come out, over there, it's a game, it's a game anyway

452
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,200
Honey, what are the villagers, what are you doing?

453
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,819

[MUSIC] I gotta get out

456
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,440
[Music] Did it happen because of the gas?

457
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,980

Ah, finally, I'm finally out, I can go home

465
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:54,900
What's not over yet? Recently in Kowloon

466
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,020
There are a lot of police reports coming in from people who have been there, but they don't exist.

467
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:02,280
Claims to have seen a city that does not

468
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,599
It was one of China's worst cities. Prior to demolition, it was home to crime and

469
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:10,920
There has also been a spike in unsavory murders. People say that the government wants to demolish Kowloon.

470
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,839
I believe he used cruel means to

471

But why are you like that until the end?
