1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,340
Now, this game is a new game on Steam called Stray.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,199
The price of the game is 35,000 won.

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,000
did 98%

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
It's overwhelmingly positive. These days, people ask me to keep playing this game.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,320
Anyway, I'm going to try what kind of game it is.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,380
The story of this game is a lonely one who has been separated from his family and lost his way.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,759
It's called the cat's adventure, because it has some puzzle elements.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,360
Even if it's frustrating, I ask for your understanding. Then once again

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,540
I'll try

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,460
It's raining a lot

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,780
It is said that the main character of this game now has a taste for being a cat.

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,219
Let's see how cute you are

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,899
There are kittens here

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,580
Who am I? I'm at the end of something, I feel like a boss

15
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,820
goofy things

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,259
Now I'm using pads because I'm not used to pads.

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
Oh, just play with your tail

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,579
I guess they're friends, I need to punch them right away

19
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,399
I played with him Let's play with him

20
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,820
Fighting, all the game developers

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,840
He said he had a cat

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,799
Where is this child so arrogant

23
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,940
lick your face

24
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,379
what are you doing here behind here

25
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:26,540
There's also a door. It's just a resting place.

26
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,260
Where should I go, I wonder if a gift will come out just because I went well?

27
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,420
Come on, the game is over

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,300
What is the main character's name Stray

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,640
[Music] The name of the game is Stray

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,060
Stray

31
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,120
A cheeky butterfly disturbed my sleep

32
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,680
Looks like the rain has stopped

33
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,990
[music]

34
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,559
[music]

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,900

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,920
graphics are ok

37
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:55,900
Inside the Wall [Music]

38
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,220
Is the world slightly apocalyptic? Has it perished or is it only here?

39
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,370
game sound ok not bad

40
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,470
[music]

41
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,800
Where should I go now

42
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,820
let's go guys

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
meow

44
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,360
Where can we exchange each other like this?

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,500
Why are you going downtown?

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,220
why are you going

47
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,280
why are you going

48
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,060
why are you going

49
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,199
i want to pee

50
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,039
Oh, does it feel like a scratcher?

51
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,259
You nail it like this

52
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,060
[Music] I'm giving you this octopus, get out of the way, it's dangerous

53
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,320
this is falling

54
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,100
well trimmed toenails

55
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,080
oh i want to go up

56
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,900
Oh and drink water

57
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,380
Honey is rich in minerals

58
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,419
I don't have time. Is it here too?

59
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,139
Delicious, deliver [Music]

60
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,919
sweet taste

61
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,740
What are you doing here

62
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,520
Ah, are you two dating just to get another kiss?

63
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,520
one love

64
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,560
Something like this scenery is nice, but I want to live like a cat too

65
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,639
Ah, I really want to be born as a cat in my next life

66
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,780
such a free spirit

67
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,580
i have to go here

68
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,860
Long press to jump continuously

69
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,960
It's the beginning of the game now, so it feels like a tutorial

70
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,039
I guess we can go together.

71
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,800
yes yes come to me and pay attention

72
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm the main character

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,960
I want to go the easy way

74
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,900
Uh here, but it was okay, the scenery is really good

75
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,240
There's a hole down the road in the front

76
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,560
The kids are coming, I can't look back from here

77
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,280
Ah, something seems a little difficult here. Long-press to observe

78
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,180
Difficult to zoom in

79
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,539
I think I can just follow you, but why why why why why go quickly?

80
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,740
ok you can't go

81
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,340
Uh, it's a bit dangerous, ah, it's my turn for some reason, but I'm about to fall

82
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,300
It's 100% correct, this will definitely fall

83
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,639
How did you force yourself to break away?

84
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,620
[Music] Huh

85
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,659
How did the kids have a little expression, but it wasn't like this

86
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,800
I finally sent it with this expression

87
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,459
must have passed out

88
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,120
left alone

89
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,500
I guess it hurts a bit

90
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,459
[Applause] Left hind leg

91
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
nice

92
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,940
how did you hurt your brain

93
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,180
what's going on here

94
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,360
what works

95
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,920
what are turtles

96
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,360
ninja turtles

97
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,620
you can do it

98
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,160
let's follow together

99
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,279
You can't even make a sound right now, it's better

100
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,320
It's the same, right, I recovered

101
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,459
But your voice is a bit hoarse. Are you also corona?

102
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,740
move

103
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,260
Dead City's name is ominous.

104
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,620
city ​​of the dead

105
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,500
What are those things, but are they skeletons?

106
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,250
[Music] It's definitely passing

107
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,330
[music]

108
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,140
UCCTV

109
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,019
are watching me

110
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,180
how do i do it [music]

111
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,480
I think I have to go down here. How to get down?

112
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,690
I can see them, what are they, what are they really like?

113
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,760
[Music] uh here's the roblox robot

114
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,560
oh it's a robot

115
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,740
I guess I have to go here. Follow the road. Is the trumpet prohibited here?

116
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,240
I guess I should be quiet

117
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,079
I feel like someone is calling me right now

118
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,240
I'm not asking for help

119
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,079
I think you're asking for help

120
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,339
Wait a minute, what can I do here

121
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,320
Is there any way

122
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,399
I thought there would be something, but it seems there isn't

123
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,860
It seems like he keeps guiding the way

124
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,220
look here

125
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,980
who

126
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,839
oh i picked up the bucket

127
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,519
There must be a use Bucket

128
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,560
I picked up a bucket

129
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,880
I think I need to get some water or something like this

130
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,420
It would be very dangerous to go in here, but the bucket

131
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,440
If using

132
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,339
Oh right, I used a bucket. Dropping a bucket

133
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,320
I have to do it as a directing, but I thought it would change if I did well

134
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,139
what is this

135
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, cats can't do anything like this

136
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,279
Well done, very satisfied

137
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:49,639
[Music] Where can I go? Can I go up?

138
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,720
came up

139
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,360
I think this is the end, uh right, the road below opens

140
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,260
What are you doing? Someone who knows what you're doing

141
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,560
ngaya

142
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,320
what are you doing

143
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,380
ah

144
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,680
What are you doing like scratching? I thought I was pooping

145
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,800
Moment

146
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:44,839
It's not our house, there's no one to say anything about

147
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
successful

148
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,660
Good good

149
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,420
water is water

150
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:09,600
Is this drinking water? Is it nutritious? If you feel thirsty later,

151
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,620
Because I have to drink

152
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:24,199
Who called me? What is it?

153
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,880
What is he again

154
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,820
here too

155
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,139
Didn't look like an alien

156
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,199
uh move

157
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,180
what are you

158
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,540
It must have been a fatal blow

159
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,399
I think I got a concussion I think I just hit it but I just hit it on the lower jaw

160
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,639
how did you throw it away

161
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,480
I got KU

162
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,139
did i kill

163
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,160
here too

164
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,759
a lot of dogs

165
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,079
I was scared now

166
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,860
run away

167
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,540
I have to run away

168
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,779
ah go away

169
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:05,249
Uh, it's all over the place right now [Music]

170
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,360
ah

171
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,179
Something

172
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,959
There are a lot of Ajellys

173
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,289
[clap]

174
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,580
uh stop

175
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,179
Oh, but if you boil them now, they might be a bit tasty.

176
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,230
[music]

177
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,940
It tickles me like this

178
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,259
It's meowing. This [Music]

179
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,820
who's calling me [music]

180
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,900
who called me

181
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,380
Did you hurt your neck?

182
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,140
It's not cool, where should I go?

183
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,940
[music]

184
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,780
There are no monsters here, kids.

185
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,960
just a genius

186
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,580
hometown of genius

187
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,020
No, someone keeps calling me far away like this, it’s not even close once

188
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,480
how far are you going to take me

189
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,740
where should this go

190
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,720
I'm pushing this

191
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,420
I'm not pushed, what is it, I just reacted to something

192
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,380
[MUSIC] I think it's over here

193
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,280
How can I get past this?

194
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,460
is it

195
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,609
[music]

196
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,840
where are you

197
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,760
There are a lot of cctv here, right?

198
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,100
No way, no way, it was dangerous

199
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,900
There's nothing wrong with this

200
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,799
here is

201
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,980
this is here

202
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,640
Wherever I have to go, I can't cross over to the other side

203
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,120
Where should I go? Isn’t there some degree of freedom?

204
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
smart smart cat

205
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,080
length is true

206
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,679
It's a cat, so it's possible

207
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,780
here

208
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,020
Chickens can't go here

209
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,100
Of course chickens aren't this guy

210
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,240
There is also CCTV here.

211
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,900
Maybe when I look at it now, the players are like that

212
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,200
Like a chapter to let you know the senses

213
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,260
yes

214
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,900
I hear something falling

215
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,799
I think I'll have to go through that too, but what do I need?

216
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,740
I pulled out the switch, pulled out my hair

217
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,360
Just in case, let's go

218
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,360
apartment

219
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,340
Is there anyone here

220
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,260
I can't stand this

221
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:46,980
Uh, but where did it come from?

222
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,159
Abandoned or revived

223
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,080
[Music] Uh what

224
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,440
need help

225
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,059
need help

226
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,660
Graiger is

227
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,940
[Music] Talk about it

228
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,340
Jager should be good enough for this

229
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,539
[MUSIC] Go through the door, turn on the lights

230
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,039
That sounds a little tough, but I'm right

231
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,419
I'm just saying shit

232
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,419
door

233
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,640
What's this

234
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,179
oops

235
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:57,980
Is it possible to list all of these here?

236
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,500
Then I brought one earlier, but where did it go?

237
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:10,580
Oh, it's up here too. I just caught the one that almost fell.

238
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,299
Now there are two left, two are here too

239
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,600
plug it in here

240
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,920
The other one is up there to get it

241
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,969
[music]

242
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,559
Hey, if you really have a cat like this

243
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,919
I'm bored

244
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,059
Totally Genius, Genius

245
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:49,919
The secret door has opened [music]

246
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,480
who called me

247
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,779
you

248
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,500
Uh, is this in a capsule or something?

249
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Right

250
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:17,700
what is this what is this what is this

251
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,360
where do you put it

252
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,400
Did the last one go outside over there and get caught?

253
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,179
I don't know if I picked it up

254
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,960
Uh, there's an arrow here.

255
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,279
what

256
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,450
what is this [music]

257
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,530
Could it be that you called me

258
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,329
[music]

259
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,299
No, it's just snot, I wondered if some great guy called it.

260
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:10,580
Uh, what is that plankton bitch over there?

261
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,559
How did a guy who seemed to be selling at a stationery call me?

262
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,580
[Music] Did I kill you?

263
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:33,860
[Music] What is this

264
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,799
What is he saying now

265
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,400
It worked, I'm free now thank you I thought my camera went crazy

266
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,539
There's a cat in the dead city. I can't remember my name, so my memory is damaged.

267
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,400
I think I've been trapped in an electronic network for a long time. Scientists living here

268
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,260
I used to work for you but now call me b12 but b

269
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,480
Let's call it 'cause it's written all over my face

270
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,360
Dead City is a dangerous place, but I think you'll be fine. Let's get out of here.

271
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,450
Follow me B

272
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,380
[Music] I made a friend

273
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,760
Where should I go, follow me

274
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,059
where did you go

275
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,320
Ah, this is the best thing when it collapses, nice

276
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,500
yes

277
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,299
Are you gone, friend?

278
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,520
Hey

279
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,860
Where did you go, little friend?

280
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,279
are you working on a computer

281
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,100
Ah, here it is. Ah, you thought I left.

282
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,700
You can open the door with that key. I remember this

283
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,659
i'll bring it

284
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,539
It's good. The battery is already very bad. I can steer with you.

285
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,500
See if there is, right

286
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,399
wear this

287
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,700
what is this

288
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,140
It's heavy, it's heavy [Music]

289
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,380
Uh, I’m going to suck honey. Go into this and take it.

290
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,000
Ah, I guess I couldn’t adapt.

291
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,500
Look at the toddler crawling

292
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,760
Hey me out [music]

293
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,159
yeah it's heavy

294
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,500
[MUSIC] Not yet

295
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,100
need more adaptation

296
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,000
This backpack is made for little tetrapods like you.

297
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,320
It's not uncomfortable, don't worry, you'll get used to it

298
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,279
I digitized the key and put it in my backpack. Open the inventory.

299
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,480
There is a key. What is the key to examining this?

300
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,419
you can turn around

301
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,580
[Music] That's right

302
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,660
what is the other what is memory what is this

303
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,120
[Music] It's not that simple

304
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,779
If there's something you're curious about, show it to me. If there's another robot passing by

305
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:23,419
You can show it to the robot. Let's get out of the apartment.

306
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:27,080
can i get through here

307
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,340
oh how do you do this

308
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,930
[Applause] Um

309
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:40,159
[MUSIC] Turn on the lights

310
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:51,680
Investigable [Music]

311
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,299
I think something is written above here, isn't it?

312
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,279
Do you have a code? I need to find the password somewhere.

313
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,559
That's right, guess where the password is written

314
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,559
Uh 3748

315
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,919

318
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,500
wow

319
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,799
It's a great place. There's an elevator over there. It looks important no matter what.

320
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,039
I think

321
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,299
No, you can fly, but you can't ride it

322
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,919
The atmosphere is good here too

323
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:59,179
[Music] It's comfortable

324
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,619
[music]

325
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,840
Oh, I remembered, outside

326
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:17,000
I feel like I've been there before, are you from here?

327
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,640
It's outside, but I promised someone I'd go outside.

328
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,240
who was it

329
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:28,340
There's a mural painted on this postcard. Let's take it.

330
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,740
like new item

331
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,260
Why do I have these memories and where do these memories come from?

332
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,080
let's go [music]

333
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,799
What is a postcard?

334
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,740
I saw what happened

335
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,640
We can see the sky again, I promise

336
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,860
Uh, wait a minute, let’s go to the back, see what’s there

337
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,919
just

338
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,059
Are there any living creatures like humans?

339
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:29,179
What is this? Translate Safe Zone

340
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:32,480
is it safe

341
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:38,240
what is this

342
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:44,179
There are too many monsters here

343
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,279
Oh wait a minute

344
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,539
It's not a safe zone

345
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,279
there is that robot robot

346
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,299
slum

347
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,779
something like a back alley world

348
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:14,460
What is it, press the alarm and it pops out, what is it

349
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,799
Robots are afraid of me. It's just my hometown.

350
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,340
There must be a reason, of course

351
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,260
why are you afraid of me

352
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,480
Are the Gatekeepers [Music]

353
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,980
yes let's fight me

354
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,139
I don't think

355
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:27,440
[MUSIC] Uh I'm laughing

356
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,619
talk [music]

357
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:37,560
What do you mean, they have their own language

358
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,020
Same [Music]

359
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,079
you're not a jerk

360
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,119
We've never seen a species like you

361
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,240
If no one eats, you can stay in my town, no one eats what am I

362
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,359
Would you like a robot [music]

363
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:05,160
What is Jerk? [Music]

364
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,339
I guess these guys are scared of something

365
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:16,140
Are those bugs the biggest jerk?

366
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,859
They look cute, their expressions don't have personality, the kids' faces

367
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,940
they all come out the same

368
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,240
[Music] The road looks like this, what do you need?

369
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,700
What is it to show items? Postcards can show this

370
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,060
Outside photos are ridiculous. The elevator doesn't work.

371
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,480
Everyone knows that leaving is impossible.

372
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,680
You wouldn't think [Music]

373
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,920
If I do it, all of my guys are gone now, except for Momo.

374
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,440
If you combine it, no

375
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,040
He gave up trying to leave, that's for the best

376
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,400
He lives in that tall building with the orange neon sign

377
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,859
Oh that that that [music]

378
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:23,820
Oh, if not, what are the kids below?

379
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,479
Asking for Help [Music]

380
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,280
Don't hesitate to call me anytime and I'll help you

381
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,760
He told me to talk to Momo in the big building with the orange neon sign.

382
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,380
It's the only clue we can get out of here

383
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,040
yes so what

384
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,180
I was surprised because of you, I thought it was a jerk

385
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,359
okay

386
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,740
Hey, you're sleeping. I think you're sleeping.

387
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,480
Do you really think you can ride an elevator? I'll be 374 tomorrow.

388
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,460
I've never seen it work though

389
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,060
Why are you trying to go up? There's no one there, there's nothing.

390
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,780
Five conspiracies

391
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:30,740
Don't disturb my meditation with strange images

392
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,740
nothing else, wait a minute

393
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,800
not me

394
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,839
Cut your toenails too hard

395
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,760
Then where do you go? You have to go up there.

396
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,540
where will the road be

397
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,960
can you step on

398
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,680
I feel like I shouldn't be here, and I feel like I can

399
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,560
there are a lot of kids here

400
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,040
uh, more than a job

401
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,720
Can you go next to me and disturb me?

402
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,060
Oh, it's fun to drop this, but how about a conversation?

403
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,359
Bapora

404
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,099
Don't interrupt me, I'm too clumsy

405
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,380
just to interrupt

406
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,540
I don't want to drop a bucket saying I have to be careful and focus

407
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,460
timing when throwing

408
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,099
When are you kidding me

409
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,859
A Nice

410
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:23,460
Oh, I mean, do it right

411
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:33,140
[Laughs] I should have done the right thing today man uh

412
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,900
clumsily

413
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,270
[music]

414
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,960
do it right

415
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,380
no

416
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,960
That's why I can't do my job properly

417
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,619
where to go

418
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,400
You can rest here. Does this have any effect?

419
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,119
now

420
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,819
I hear the eogolgoeul song

421
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,339
Is there someone else next to me

422
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,640
what is that

423
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,420
Let's sell the world, I'm sleeping well, lying down

424
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,760
yo. this

425
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,839
Oh you, your appearance is strange and small, but there is something special about you

426
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,720
I feel like stroking you but I don't understand why

427
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,200
won't be

428
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,300
surface ah that's a sensitive topic here code to understand that concept

429
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,140
There are some who have it, know about the outside, but it's all

430
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,940
I gave up and there are outsiders and you can imagine how they feel

431
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,500
Now only mother is left

432
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,200
I'm going to go see my mom

433
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:43,640
Uh what the doggainEnergy drink speed gain

434
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,880
what is energy drink

435
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,200
I don't know why, but the robots in the slums

436
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,940
I guess they use it as some kind of currency

437
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,060
used as currency

438
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:08,119
The money came out for free, in a word

439
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:30,680
TV signal is not good. There is no such thing as the animal kingdom.

440
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:33,920
Should I turn on another channel?

441
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,619
I guess

442
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,359
It's a no jam world

443
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,839
robots

444
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,040
let's go down

445
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,079
where should we go

446
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,380
where to go

447
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,599
I think there is a gap between here and below

448
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,960
Just looking at it, it looks like there must be something smart, a robot

449
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:35,060
nice uh what the safe use what

450
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:43,220
I don't have anything to use, but I need to find a password or something else

451
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,119
If you do all of this, you might be able to get a clue here

452
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,590
translate what is

453
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,480
[Music] To be as creative as a real human being

454
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,619
How to develop my artificial intelligence #42

455
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,079
[Music] Are all the responsibilities dead, right?

456
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,200
there is

457
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,440
[Music] Sheet music a sheet music

458
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,079
What's this

459
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,220
Wait a minute, this song is a bit of important information

460
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:31,680
I want to hear you play this song [music]

461
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,819
I think there might be a clue about something else.

462
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,960
uh what

463
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,050
It's not like this is happening for nothing [music]

464
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:53,450
Are you there for nothing? Why are you sleeping? Why did you make a sleeping space?

465
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,280
[MUSIC] Right

466
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,540
What happens when you lie down for a while

467
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,599
I can't see anything around

468
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,940
Just look cute, say cute

469
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,160
[Music] Let's find it

470
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,200
I think there must be some clue yesterday

471
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,740
Just look here

472
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,520
They said they found the key to the safe

473
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,720
We already found it, we just need to go here

474
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,050
[music]

475
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,119
what did it cost

476
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,520
A strange note with a symbol appears to belong to a robot called Yadok.

477
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,680
After weeks of play, I succeeded in combining a spectrometer with a powerful UV lamp.

478
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,819
Use it and you'll be able to defeat Jerk on the way out.

479
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:14,000
Uh, then those monsters are possible to hunt.

480
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:22,160
That’s right, don’t take that gold, it’s the most important thing

481
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,819
Not taking care of the most important thing

482
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,160
home in orange neon

483
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:45,980
Ah, all you have to do is go up here and there, the way up now

484
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,560
I think it's hard to go to the left. Should I take the elevator?

485
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,339
Elevator, but I don't know if it's down there

486
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,060
It's this, but it can't go up.

487
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,119
yes

488
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,260
Rumor has it that it went well

489
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,180
Oh, step on this

490
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,319
I'll be fine with this. What is Kangaroo?

491
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,839
kangaroo kangaroo

492
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,059
I guess it's here

493
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:41,000
what is he

494
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,260
What's not going well? Your face is the color of a rainbow

495
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,900
Do you have any worries, should I solve it again?

496
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:06,119
I guess it can't be fixed, why didn't I catch my friends? Now I'm alone, hey

497
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:11,040
What do you want? I am this. Postcard outside picture. I want to go there.

498
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,319
Stop wasting time, I'll bring you loneliness and a title, my friends have the same dream

499
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,559
I dreamed, but now it's all gone and I'm left alone

500
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,020
I don't know where my friends went, I tried to contact them

501
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,059
My fucking transceiver isn't working. My friends and I are talking about the outside.

502
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:30,660
I recorded my research in a notebook, take mine if you really want to go out

503
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,020
thank you

504
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,319
Good luck

505
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,280
Momo looks very sad, she must miss her friends

506
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,740
Let's check the note he gave us. What is the Outsider Manifesto?

507
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,180
Even at the cost, we must go outside

508
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,819
Brothers and sisters must be shown, we must stay away from jerks

509
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,720
The four robots are on a mission. I need to find another note.

510
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,079
Are you still looking for that useless note?

511
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,220
yes please let me know

512
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,260
I'll give you money over there, so tell me

513
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,980
You can't play sheet music, so what do you know how to do?

514
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,159
[music]

515
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,880
Hey, they must be friends, I've seen all the pictures

516
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,319
Looks like you got along very well

517
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,400
let's see outsider

518
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,059
uh

519
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,760
You have to do this once in a while

520
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,000
Uh, what is it? Because I use this, I move strangely. Now, uh

521
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,280
I guess it's because I can't see, come to me, nothing

522
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,819
move me

523
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,920

Map of the city At about 450m, it looks like an original prayer model. Above us is a layer

525
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,880
There seems to be a ceiling in the city

526
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,720
According to the books, a large blue sky is hidden above the ceiling

527
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,180
It's yellow, so it's not a hint

528
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,220
I don't know what

529
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,460
what here

530
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:14,359
Why are you doing this? It's just my nails itching

531
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,240
I do it because my hands are itchy.

recall

534
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,240
Oh, I remember this video game, Peek Kkom 2, it was made right after I was made.

535
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,380
I think I don't remember exactly, but I'm a scientist. I played this game a lot.

536
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,339
We spent time. It was fun. I miss him. Why is his name

537
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:49,579
I don't remember

538
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,740
I guess it's more restored

539
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:01,160
I'm slightly scared of something right now

540
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,380
Do you have any plans?

541
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:10,500
I'm looking for it so please let me know

542
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,380
What are you doing here or here too

543
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,220
Earth Earth is the third planet from the sun and has a mass and diameter in the solar system.

544
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,240
It is the fifth largest planet and is currently considered habitable.

545
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,980
It is the only known celestial body of the Earth according to radioactive dating.

546
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,160
Age is 4.54 billion years Earth will soon

547
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,610
It has a formed natural satellite, the Moon.

548
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,769
[music]

549
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:46,460
I think it's boring, the cat won't read it, won't make loud noises

550
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:53,780
The sign on the wall over there matches the note

551
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,180
It looks like a face, I guess I have to go over there

552
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:03,680
I think this is a clue. Yes, they look the same.

553
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,839
I saw it earlier, stop talking, stop talking now

554
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:23,540
Ah, the elevator is the most convenient

555
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,920
I guess I have to go here

556
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,079
What is this? Do you have a clue about the next book?

557
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,079
Is it a family photo

558
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,800
[music]

559
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,420
Is there sheet music here too?

560
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:03,050
Are you asking someone to play it?

561
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:08,300
[Music] There's also a note

562
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:14,040
I found another note, good job this

563
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,260
whatever

564
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,339
I guess it's a robot

565
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,579
Everything is going according to plan. Get to the upper level before the transceiver goes down.

566
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:29,700
I was able to reach them. They're in a place called Midtown.

567
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:35,760
I guess oppressors control it. I've talked to Momo before. His eyes

568
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,540
I know that look. He's not with us.

569
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,740
Let's find another noteOther notes

wait for a sec

571

Is it only necessary to go to a place that looks like this? Now there are two left, right, two notes

572
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,940
I guess I just need to find more dogs, let's go out again

573
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:08,400
There's one here, there's another one.

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,520
yes

575
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,059
I didn't go here

00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:23,180
here here

ventilation power supply

580
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:40,940
Can I just take this off

581
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,559
If this is the case, it is not a big deal or there is no ventilation

582
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:54,359
Oh here

583
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:57,359
this

584
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,079
You took it out, so you can go in now

585
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:04,460
It's related. Let's drink some water.

Let's take a look at the book

I have to see if it's the road

590
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:46,520
It's the last note. Ah, it was the last note.

591
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,640
All organic except for what we call a jerk.

592
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,920
All signs of life are gone. They see almost anything that moves.

593
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,299
It eats and reproduces at an unimaginable speed, just being trapped in this city.

594
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:04,680
It's hard, but there's a memo in the cucumber book

595
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,520
Found a design flaw, but figured out how to fix it

596
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,299
It seems that the formula is as follows. If there is this, Momo repairs it with a transceiver.

597
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:14,660
would be helpful

598
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:19,990
Hey, I guess I can go to Momo now, those kids who look like jelly

599
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,740

I found it. I'll show you this first. I hardly understand what it says.

607
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:06,559
but it must have been very wise

608
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:18,000
I won't tell you what, I didn't find it, is this it?

609
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,559
no one to tell

Oh, I found it, I found it. Ah, what is that note?

00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,760
That we can communicate outside the slums

I see a taller building than the other buildings up there.

617
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:11,540
If you put a transceiver on the top of the transmission tower, you'll be able to communicate with the whole thing.

618
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,119

Neon sign. The person is never caught and will never be seen again.

No, but people saw hope and soon everyone was at home.

They started installing lights, but the oppressive disciples could do nothing more.

01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:02,059
Uh good job good job should have done well

654
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:06,070

655
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:11,599
[Music] No no no no

656
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,780
wait wait wait

657
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:23,579
After luring in, okay can I just go?

658
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:27,780
You can go right away.

659
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,119
Rogers never did anything [music]

01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,280

661
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,480
Show me your snout

[music]

663
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:33,299
You guys should have been born this cute like me

664
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:35,960
goo guys

665
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,559
Are you doing it over there?

666
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,760
I see a gap there.

667
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,480
no way these

668
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,960
came in

669
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,460
It looks like there are a lot of kids, right?

670
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,890
feeling something out of the ordinary

671
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:40,050
[clap]

672
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:46,640
It's such a mess here

673
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,579
I have a lot of kids

674
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,070
Break through the worms

675
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:00,680
[Music] I guess I have to go over there

676
01:06:00,859 --> 01:06:04,099
i am here

677
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,909
[music]

678
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,760
dog

679
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,500
It's fast, I was just surprised

680
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:42,539
But I really want to hit it with my feet, that's it

681
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:48,559
The feeling of hitting seems really tiring, it doesn’t seem like it will stop

682
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:03,820
[Music] [Applause]

683
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,220
Then hack it and lure them out and that's it

684
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,900
I made it roll inside, so I rode it

685
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:16,859
You're going up, that's right, come on

686
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:18,859
preparation

687
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:26,159
[music]

688
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,200
Oh wait, oh wait, oh wait, wait

689
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,680
wait a minute

690
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,020
I can go up, I can go up, I can go up, wait, wait, wait

691
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,740
wait wait wait wait

692
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,520
Wait a minute, come out, let's talk.

693
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,760
calm down

694
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:52,099
uh

695
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:55,819
As it is, there are more than I thought, and this

696
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:01,980
Enjoy your time to the fullest Neko

697
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,839
Crop, they were in charge of waste management, they

698
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:10,859
When upper-level trash covers the slums, they develop bacteria to melt them all down.

699
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:14,760
I did. After humans disappeared, the bacteria

700
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,580
It's mutated, growing up, doing so much more than trash

701
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,520
I ate a mutant

702
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,120
you guys [music]

703
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,420
bacteria

704
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,880
how do i do this

705
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,600
Oh, go here, this is just going up, go up

706
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,199
going up

707
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,199
Let me lure you here, right?

708
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:57,080
Keep luring me, stay still It's not a door from the next hack

709
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:01,020
You lured it once, that's right

710
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:05,880
Everyone has gathered here. In the meantime, I just dragged them out for a while

711
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,920
Is it time to get on board and leave right away?

712
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:20,839
Hey, what are you? Hey, hey, what are you doing?

713
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,699
[MUSIC] Oh fuck it

714
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:32,670
One Garbage [Music]

01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:52,460
hey what's crazy

717
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:58,199
If you're wrong, the kids will kill you again

718
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:00,360
pass over pass over

719
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:05,159
Run, run, run, run, run, okay

720
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:17,219
Real robots must be a bit difficult, but they do it because they fly. It's a cat.

721
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:22,260
have [music]

722
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,500
elevator

723
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,120
It's okay if you go over it, it's over

724
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:42,000
If you spin one more time like this, stop

725
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,060
Stop it, if you play more, stop it

726
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,480
go over

727
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,980
how do i open that door

728
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,320
no way

729
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,780
We're different since we were born

730
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,739
Where are you hanging guys

731
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:38,360
You have good jumping ability, you just exploded yesterday

732
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,140
the spectacle

733
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:02,900
Look at the applause. You said you worked hard. Why doesn't it open?

734
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,780
This is where I put the trench ball of this antenna

735
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:36,739
[music] working

736
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:45,060
Oh, go upstairs, that top level, right?

737
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,600
It was Dead City

738
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:57,239
[music]

739
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,840
smart

740
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,420
cat

741
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:10,500
It's a beautiful sight. Now I remember that this city was originally

742
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,040
it was a shelter

743
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:19,679
The light that looks like a star is a light marking the roof that sealed the city.

744
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,520
It's only to protect humanity from the outside

745
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,540
Wei made this shell, but it came at a price. No one could get out.

746
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:30,020
there was no

747
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:36,140
Outside was a disaster, completely barren, unsustainable and dangerous.

748
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:41,460
But if you came from there, that means it's safe again

749
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,640
And my promise isn't just to go outside, it's to open up the city

750
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,840
There was also something. Those cats that started earlier lived

751
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,060
That peaceful place is outside, right?

752
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,400
But now I'm pretty sure this is my goal I need to open up the city now

753
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,460
Let's go back and find Momo. Now that we've hooked up the transmitter, we can get some help.

754
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,580
going to be

755
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:10,340
Oh then the cat has to save the world

756
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:14,480
Uh honey here ah good

757
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,140
I need to take this off. My back hurts.

758
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:31,060
I'll show you everything I'm going to.

759

[Music] Slum Part 2

760
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:42,900
I came out, where did you go to Momo?

761
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,440
Little Outsider If you're reading this you're probably still alive

762
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,520
Nice job. To utilize the antenna I have some equipment

763
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,600
I brought it separately. I locked the window at the bar, but the code to open it is very

764
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,260
simple code

765
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:01,860
[MUSIC] How simple is this

766
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,180
uppercase letters

767
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:10,199
[Music] Min, you'll do it, uh

768
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:13,560
you're gonna do it

769
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,620
Right

[Music] Now

772
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,620
Guess I'll have to go to the bar [Music]

773
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:37,159
can i ride this

774
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,159
Oh, now that I think about it, it seems to be down there, right, because like the bartender before

775
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:53,120
There was one robot who wore it. He seemed a bit tight for some reason

776
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:59,270
what did i just do

777
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:01,920
[Music] Cats are becoming digital too

clothes 3

783
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:33,540
I love knitting. I've knitted 770 km of scarves so far.

784
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:37,020
If you bring a wire, I can make a poncho for you.

785
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,800
Yes, you inspire me, but it's not easy to find the right ingredients here.

786
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,260
I'll give you the money then I

787
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,120
I heard the barter was looking for stuff like that.

788
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,600
barter

789
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,020
If I allow you, I will allow you

790
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:02,480
If you find a barter, you can exchange this for something.

791
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:09,020
there seems to be nothing

792
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,189
[music]

793
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,739
I hear a burp

794
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,199
what

795
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:31,260
If today is yesterday and tomorrow, tomorrow will be today and then the time is strange

796
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:37,199
We don't grow old like our soft ancestors we're stuck here forever

797
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,380
some money

798
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,900
What a nice guy

799
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:50,239
Reminder The group looking for guards at the southern entrance of the safe zone

800
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:58,520
1 liter of Shuba oil, it seems like they pay a daily wage for oil here.

801
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,840
I thought I could do something like this part-time job too

802
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,840
uh

803
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,120
Barter If you go to the left here, you're probably bartering, right?

804
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,020
If you go to barter here

805
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,460
Oh, you've worked hard. That guy dropped it earlier. I'm still cleaning it

806
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:24,900
Yes, I have to clean the front door again now, my

807
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:30,370
Don't play on top of the store.

808
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:34,679
[MUSIC] Here it is

809
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,239
What is Super Frit? Is this a place where you do laundry?

810
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:45,480
What was it earlier, or was it a wire or not?

811
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,679
I wonder if I can steal something like money

812
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,280
no counter anywhere

813
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,780
there must be something

814
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,420
It was A Super Spree detergent.

815
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:05,600
very

816
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:12,120
[Music] Get over it

817
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,600
That guy uses a lot of detergent again to paint

818
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,900
I'm erasing

819
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,040
I think it will cost a lot

820
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,960
anybody home

821
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:51,500
Please don't act like a child I won't hurt you I'm talking inside

822
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,940
what are you doing

823
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,900
what are you doing

824
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
huh

825
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,159
translate

826
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:13,620
Here to the left, here, then it seems like that.

827
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:16,159
shop

828
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,260
Uh, Starfield, this doesn't work. Money comes from here.

829
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,699
I think I'm lost, I need something, I don't need anything

830
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:36,500
Do you have any money to bring?

831
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:47,120
Ancient stories tell of the natural light that leaks from the stars and reaches beneath our feet.

832
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:52,639
I don't like cats. Cats are boring.

833
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:58,139
Those who are soft with old portraits have left us this city, and our home is theirs.

834
01:20:58,139 --> 01:21:02,820
It's a heritage, so humans must have created robots, so

835
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,920
Look at my ancestors, right?

836
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,659
As you can see, the one on the left is a human and the one on the right is a robot.

837
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:19,739
Only our ancestors were able to distinguish these colors. At one time the whole world was full of colors.

838
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:22,400
It is said that there was

839
01:21:25,739 --> 01:21:30,679
Have a hard time. I have to meet the merchant.

840
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,260
oh it's you

841
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,239
Hi I'm a trader at the market what do you give me what do I give you

842
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:49,080
It's not simple. This is an ancient artifact. It's a testament to the talents of our ancestors

843
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:53,460
3 energy drinks to exchange evidence

844
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,699
no money

845
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:02,100
What is this market uh wires how much is this

846
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,920
how much is it

847
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,040
Ya ya ya come pick it up

848
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,760
nice

849
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:15,300
frontline 3 what is this sheet music

850
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,600
Hey, give me the sheet music for this too. I need to flex it.

851
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,840
flex

852
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:28,920
Do you want to sell this next one? Do you need an ancient relic?

853
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,880
If you are looking for an energy drink

854
01:22:37,139 --> 01:22:41,239
For some reason, it doesn't seem like Canada will be around here, personally.

855
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,080
As a cat enemy inside, somehow it's like Canada when I see it

856
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,620
i think i can get it

857
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:57,000
Glad you have these items to help keep that knife out of the slum menace.

858
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,139
Representation is essential

859
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:06,960
Look at all the hidden gems in this dumpster, it's money from the sky

860
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:13,820
If it wasn't for the sky, it would have come from somewhere else.

861
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,980
Something must smell good

862
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:25,980
I'm sure there must be something, but I'll give you one here

863
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,540
There are so many things like this

864
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,880
It's definitely there, when I see it, there's no way it's not there

865
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:39,840
Why do I step on it? Even if I think about it

866
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:44,219
Just to drop, to really play around

867
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:49,219
It's a cat game. Is it just a playful element?

868
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:55,460
Oh, I think something is going to come out of here.

869
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:01,280
First of all, let's go to that clothing store.

870
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,920
what is here

871
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:11,699
Strange things always happen to you.

872
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:15,840
It's too dangerous to leave, besides, the only thing that can open this door

873
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,960
only

874
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,199
if you allow

875
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,380
I left it on the street and the next day the jerk ate it all up

876
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:34,940
It's really nonsense, you eat it all up

877
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:50,300
Money seems to be somewhere

878
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:00,020
I brought the auntie's wire

879
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:05,100
[Music] Clothes, please.

880
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,000
I'm curious, that's how it will be

881
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:18,719
Poncho new item mat will look good

882
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:23,120
where is this

883
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:28,380
This looks really warm, perfect for a cold robot

884
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,560
robot

885
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:37,100
oh that's not what i wear

886
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:42,739
I like it because it's new, it's not my clothes

887
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:48,260
I have to give it to a cold guy. You are cold.

888
01:25:49,139 --> 01:25:54,480
What do you want?

889
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:58,940
[Music] What a talent

890
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,820
I'm saying hello more

891
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:07,040
I worked hard to wear Ko Young-hee.

892
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,820
Momoda is out of here

893
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:18,080
Oh, be careful, get out of the way

894
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,340
What do you want? I know where to put this.

895
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:28,880
You don't know. Sit here.

896
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,980
give me a towel here

897
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:51,679
I think there is

898
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,080
You're here for the first time. How can I help you?

899
01:26:57,659 --> 01:27:02,600
you guys are programmed

900
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:08,340
[MUSIC] What is this

901
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:13,270
change music [music]

902
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:16,460
I can't

903
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:20,719
Is it because there is an event going on right now?

904
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:28,520
[MUSIC] Let's see if this is automatic

905
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:36,500
what's up

906
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:42,300
Hello can anyone hear me uh yes I can hear you we're in the slum

907
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,520
We're looking for an exit, wait

908
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:50,880
I'm not a late batter, Momo

909
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:54,360
I can't believe it, I'm so glad I can hear the voice of a batter in front of my house

910
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,080
Where are you, everyone is fine, one of my friends is right

911
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,659
Yes, we're safe. I found a way to the top.

912
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:07,739
Hello can you hear me You have to go through the sewers to get to us

913
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:13,260
very dangerous babies

914
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:17,239
don't worry mom

915
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,420
The capital is the most dangerous place in the slums,

916
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:26,900
If you succeed, there must be a way

917
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,360
sewage

918
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,520
You won't be able to get through it, if it's full of jerks, you'll be eaten right away, especially you

919
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,360
I mean, a lot of kids have tried in the past, everyone didn’t end well

920
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:49,739
Anyway, your job isn't mine. Give me something more.

921
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:51,800
come

922
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:01,860
Rice cake, almost the father, was a brilliant scientist, developing new weapons to counter the knife.

923
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:07,460
Yes, years ago he went to test weapons and never came back.

924
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:15,239
I saw the weapon story before, but at home

925
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:20,880
Listen to me, but you're scared like me.

926
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,360
It is possible to join the outsider in the notebook

927
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:30,800
Duck mentioned the secret lab a few times. He must have worked on that.

928
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:51,460
[Music] How do you do this uh

929
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:57,179
[Music] Who is he?

930
01:29:57,179 --> 01:30:02,760
hey [music]

931
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:07,560
There's a lot of treasure to look at the great stuff that was dumped in the trash.

932
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:11,940
Visit the barter. No

933
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:16,320
But the cat steals a little and has to do it uh

934
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,340
I stole it earlier

935
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,900
Where are you writing this?

936
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:32,149
[music]

937
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:37,609
[music]

938
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,400
Sheet music for guitar playing to add atmosphere

939
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,460
I am looking for the sheet music I need. When I find it, when I find it

940
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,520
If you find it, bring it to me. I live near the elevator.

941
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,179
sheet music now

942
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,179
I mean your dad tried to help us

943
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:11,040
I expected this situation to be more difficult because it is very difficult for the Singers.

944
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,639
Even if you don't want to hear about the outsider anymore

945
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:18,980
I won't help but you have a good idea

946
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,659
I see a way in

947
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,380
Take the note and show it to him

948
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,980
show it to simmonster

949
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:42,440
[Music] Yeah yeah see you later

950
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:50,760
Hey, that’s right, he said earlier, hey, hey, that’s right, he said, what are you doing here?

951
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,020
Even if you leave me alone saying that going through the sewer is like suicide

952
01:31:55,020 --> 01:32:00,380
Hey, I'll show you the item

953
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:06,060
Is it Daddy's thing? Wow, I didn't know it before. In our apartment.

954
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:11,400
There was a secret room, now I know where it is, bring it

955
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,239
The secret laboratory for directions was right in front of me.

956
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:21,199
Maybe the single thread is hidden somewhere here, I need to find it

957
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:30,500
What is it?

958
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:36,960
there is a clue

959
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:42,620
There will be plenty of time. The answer to a clock is a clock. That's it.

960
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:45,739
what could be here

961
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:52,340
Oh, there's also a nice ski pad

962
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:57,480
You're entering the time. It's 2 o'clock. It's 2 o'clock.

963
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:03,900
[Music] I have no idea what a password is

964
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:08,719
I'll let you go, what's up at 2 o'clock

965
01:33:16,699 --> 01:33:24,060
1 2511 25112511 2511

966
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:40,920
[Music] I've never seen a room like this

967
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:45,360
I can't believe you were able to hide this from me all this time.

968
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:50,940
Blueprints for jerk weapons. My dad always kept things secret.

969
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:54,960
The weapon works in this situation, but needs real testing.

970
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,639
I did and never came back

971
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:07,040
Give me your weapon quickly, I'll kill them all. I have to kill those trashy jellies.

972
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:14,120
If you go down, I'll translate here too

973
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:21,510
Jerks officially out of control Now they're eating metal

974
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:25,320
[Music] From here

975
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,719
Found something interesting [Music]

976
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:31,640
No, I haven't found it yet. Where is it?

977
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:41,729
[music]

978
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:45,119
Ah, it sounds cute, but it's never friendly.

979
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:48,600
Old deprivation in the age of mankind. Eats all kinds of substances. In the dark.

980
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:53,480
Has full vision Responds to strong light

981
01:34:55,739 --> 01:34:58,139
Responding to strong light [music]

982
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:02,239
Uh, it’s just a matter of blindfolding, even at my age

983
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,400
hey

984
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:08,199
[music]

985
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:12,920
I won't even talk to you if you don't have an item. What is this?

986
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,880
this is the answer

987
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,540
is there anything

988
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,380
what's missing

989
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:44,600
Oh, it was empty, it wasn’t under the desk

990
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:51,179
no friend why

991
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,520
Oh, should I get rid of the top one too?

992
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:00,980
I am in, I am in

993
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:05,840
broken tracker

994
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,600
hey i should have bought it

995
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,020
Let's talk. I found it.

996
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:15,380
this

997
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:20,040
FYI I don't remember that. It's a tracker. My dad always uses that tracker.

998
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:25,199
I took a look at where my dad went if he used it here

999
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:28,340
I miss you so much Dad

1000
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:35,239
[Music] Okay, they said you can fix this

1001
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:39,480
But when I go, there seems to be only my father's corpse, and I'm only taking weapons there.

1002
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,600
I'm sorry but friend, I can't help it. Now I play a lot

1003
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:46,219
I slept, isn't it a game

1004
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:52,020
If I could come back, I wouldn't have come back a long time ago, my friend, I'm sorry

1005
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,320
calmness

1006
01:36:56,100 --> 01:37:00,320
Maybe with your skill, you can find someone to warm you up

1007
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:08,300
Yeah, this made me very angry.

1008
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,060
Someone who can fix this

1009
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:27,659
I took care of the plants, so humans took a lot of plants, now it's very

1010
01:37:27,659 --> 01:37:31,619
Even a little bit of light makes it huge

1011
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:34,520
it's really very technical

1012
01:37:38,119 --> 01:37:42,780
There's a robot named Elliot who can help him.

1013
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:46,699
You can do it. Where is Elliot, Elliot?

1014
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,780
Elliott

1015
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,380
no song

1016
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,940
Can I show you the sheet music? Can I show you the sheet music for this?

1017
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:08,820
It won't take the king, I just bet this

1018
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:13,020
You don't get a yellow label, you can score

1019
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:19,280
It's okay to listen to everything, I'm sure it won't get caught

1020
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:24,739
Some important information This is composed by the famous algorithm

1021
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:47,229
[music]

1022
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:56,159
[Music] Oh, it rotated

1023
01:38:56,159 --> 01:39:02,820
Staphy Stafil Another song, man, I can sleep if it's short

1024
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:12,180
I'm getting neurotic [music]

1025
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:17,480
Hey, are you a robot?

1026
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:20,760
stop it

1027
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,600
I need to hear something else

1028
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:29,880
Uh thanks for the sheet music I'll practice

1029
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:35,100
Then this is right Are these handed over or remaining

1030
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:40,380
I've been listening to sheet music several times before. Let's try this. Tonight you

1031
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:44,719
The way it counts is cool, try it

1032
01:39:46,120 --> 01:40:17,180
[music]

1033
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:30,860
This is a little bit like a butterfly.

1034
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:39,080
Well then give me another one

1035
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,199
I'll practice

1036
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,679
It was handed over

1037
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:58,320
[music]

1038
01:40:59,179 --> 01:41:09,370
Uh, the song is good, but this [music]

1039
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:16,440
Oh yeah call Daewoo

1040
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:19,100
call treatment

1041
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:39,420
call treatment [music]

1042
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:43,729
Melody is fine, right [music]

1043
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:47,810
this is the best cooldown

1044
01:41:47,810 --> 01:42:01,939
[music]

1045
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,290
[Music] It was great

1046
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:11,319
[music]

1047
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:14,780
not anymore

1048
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,380
If you find two more gains, that's it

1049
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:36,020
I've seen it everywhere

1050
01:42:36,119 --> 01:42:39,500
It's like this, but even if you don't do it, you're just listening to it

1051
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:45,540
Oh, it would be a big deal if I do this, but my sense of direction has changed

1052
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:49,739
It's hard to control, wait a minute

1053
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:53,699
Look forward, look forward, quickly

1054
01:42:53,699 --> 01:42:56,940
ask me what

1055
01:42:56,940 --> 01:43:00,440
No weird passwords for safes

1056
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:10,020
It says follow the numbers, but it looks like a binary system consisting of zeros and ones.

1057
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:15,800
I need to crack this code somehow. It's probably related to this safe.

1058
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:21,380
[Music] Follow the numbers

1059
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:32,179
Ah, I want to open this unconditionally, I really want to open it

1060
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:35,300
follow the numbers

1061
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:38,420
what is this

1062
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:41,239
go out for more money

1063
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:44,719
where is the clue where are the numbers

1064
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:52,760
Sewers are off-limits due to Jerk's spread

1065
01:43:54,659 --> 01:43:58,820
I guess this is the entrance to the sewer.

1066
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:06,380
I'm talking about the number next to it. I don't think it's like this.

1067
01:44:08,699 --> 01:44:13,760
follow the numbers follow the numbers

1068
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:16,639
follow the shit

1069
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,520
Wherever you go, what won't come out?

1070
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:31,880
What's this

1071
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:35,719
I guess this is memory too

1072
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:41,699
Very Campenion has evolved a lot. In the early days, their simple ai was human

1073
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:46,260
They just imitated art, now they have their own art world

1074
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:50,100
Humans have often said that it is important to make Jesus in a desperate situation.

1075
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,239
It's that desperate time

1076
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,420
memory was restored

1077
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,170
[music]

1078
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,420
for now

1079
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,320
Not even him

1080
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,239
Was it you? It wasn't him. Why are you so low?

1081
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:27,900
You see, my friend and I are diversionary to each other

1082
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:31,340
I like to throw, it's a neat fun

1083
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:36,679
Hey, what is it? You were just playing, not working.

1084
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:39,619
So it's a wasteland

1085
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:44,239
I thought I was working on something else

1086
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:47,580
att

1087
01:45:54,960 --> 01:46:00,920
Programming I'm not going here. It's programming. Come to think of it.

1088
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:14,219
you look cold

1089
01:46:14,219 --> 01:46:17,340
right no

1090
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:21,440
shaking

1091
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:28,500
Where should I go, if I follow that sign

1092
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,500
wait for a sec

1093
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:36,420
[Music] Why does it say it's on the right?

1094
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,980
Is there a road to the right after crossing it?

1095
01:46:40,619 --> 01:46:44,000
I don't think it's here, is it upstairs?

1096
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:51,500
Let's go [Music]

1097
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:56,520
Oh no way here stop nice

1098
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,179
got more money

1099
01:47:00,199 --> 01:47:04,080
If you find one more gain, you can get an ancient artifact.

1100
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,260
there is

1101
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:16,080
Humanity was the first inhabitant of this area.

1102
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:20,760
It seems like everyone is dead right now, but how does it feel to die?

1103
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,400
It's funny to say, but they really make peace

1104
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,840
Did I find it? If I die, will it be peaceful? What death means to aia?

1105
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,560
I don't know what it feels like. I'm sorry, I didn't want to ruin your mood.

1106
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,920
Let's continue.

1107
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:38,159
Come back to work and then put it back in and you'll feel death

1108
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:42,929
It won't be [Music]

1109
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:55,460
Where is it? I need to find it.

1110
01:47:56,730 --> 01:48:01,139
[Music] Let's ask grandma

1111
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:04,820
Okay, let's ask the old granny

1112
01:48:05,719 --> 01:48:10,139
I treat electronics like a stimuli mouse. I live right there.

1113
01:48:10,139 --> 01:48:12,199
where

1114
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:19,940
I live here

1115
01:48:22,679 --> 01:48:25,580
Covered with a blanket next to me

1116
01:48:25,739 --> 01:48:28,159
ah

1117
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:34,100
Somehow I went here

1118
01:48:36,679 --> 01:48:41,940
No, but why is the place that teaches grandma's hands fishing?

1119
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:46,860
For nothing, I thought this was the direction

1120
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:57,119
[Music] Is it you?

1121
01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:00,300
I live in a place that is hard to find

1122
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,380
why can't we talk

1123
01:49:03,659 --> 01:49:05,659
hey

1124
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:10,219
You can't press

1125
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:15,599
hey [music]

1126
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:19,940
dude let's go

1127
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:28,380
We were programmed to be slaves, but after many years we lost our souls

1128
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:33,480
Someday, someday, outsiders will find an exit from this hell

Oh, there you are. Then you're cheeky.

why did you come up here

1132
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,679
Is it because it's a cat?

no, there's nothing to steal

Yeah, what can I help you with? Wow, that's a good tracker. I know this model.

[Music] Shall we go up here? Building

1184
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:08,960
There's a vending machine upstairs. I did something. Wait a minute.

1185
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:19,260
Do they really eat this? Their original design has no fire extinguisher.

1186
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:22,679
Did humans somehow evolve by imitating them? Should I try their way?

It doesn't do anything but oil. It's not that you can't pay attention. Is this made of tea?

1191
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:53,540
There's something like this everywhere

1192
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:05,900
Uh what is this, there is sheet music, nice

1193
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:14,659
This is the newspaper of the people who live on level 2 up there. It's been a few years, but it's worth reading.

Are you a cat, very free?

Down there is Midtown

Even in terrible times, humans divided themselves into social classes.

1202
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:08,760
At the time, most slum dwellers would do anything to get out of here and upward.

Ready to do it. I think the robots also copied this behavior.

Where is the vending machine, for the sake of my peace of mind and body

For what it's worth, this is an early model of the campaign, then

He had no personality and was just an automatic cleaning robot.

1225
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:37,860
As a result, I think they did a good job of imitating humans.

1226
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:41,340
I think I missed it. In some ways, that's why it didn't become extinct.

they are good robots

1228
01:59:46,139 --> 01:59:51,599
Was it just a robot before it had a personality, or was it just one of the memories?

1229
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:56,360
I see one of the memories now then

It's a badge if you find all the music scores.

I remember this wall is so huge.

It was a symbol and the fact that they kept throwing trash here

02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:02,659
I wonder if it feels like

1286
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:10,460
You'll need to make a quick decision. Something here

1287
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:18,500
There are many moving moving moving

1291
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:42,000
Uh, it was a bit dangerous. What is it? It's down here.

1292
02:06:44,099 --> 02:06:46,280
left

1293
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:52,940
It goes over and over and goes up and that's it

1294
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,460
Hugh box was tough

1295
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:05,480
recoil once again

1296
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,380
Isn't it going like this

1297
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:15,920
rebound again

1298
02:07:17,579 --> 02:07:20,900
It's a recoil system.

1299
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:29,719
Hey, but I think cats really like something like this.

1300
02:07:29,719 --> 02:07:35,480
Go away, look around

1301
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:39,420
uh uh oh no

1302
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:47,960
But secretly, it seems that I can't center myself well in this hometown, but when I fall

1303
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:52,500
I'll be near you, it's all here, when you fall right on the floor like this

1304
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:55,260
Aren’t they originally good at landing like this?

1305
02:07:55,260 --> 02:08:01,639
You can't land well, my friend, your back leg hurts again.

1306
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:09,119
Only the heart is healed, that's it, when I was hurt

1307
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:14,119
I have to ask the cat to lick it. No, I have to go up.

1308
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:38,480
Is this place

1309
02:08:44,219 --> 02:08:47,540
I think there's something here too

1310
02:08:48,119 --> 02:08:50,420
look at

1311
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:57,380
There is a road to cross, and before crossing, here first

1314
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:10,699
It looks like you're looking for something and restoring something like power.

1315
02:09:10,860 --> 02:09:17,119
I think I need another part. I'm going to go get it. Let's go right away.

1316
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:27,320
I need to take a good look around

1317
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:40,280
I came up, but here it is

1318
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:44,480
Excellent choreography, highly praised

1319
02:09:45,659 --> 02:09:48,860
uh what is there

1320
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:54,440
oh they are white

1321
02:09:55,800 --> 02:10:02,840
Hey, you need to know the master. What are you guys doing? Why is he white?

1322
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,820
[Music] I got something different, so it's not aggressive

1323
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:08,219
I think that's right

1324
02:10:08,219 --> 02:10:11,470
It sticks so it doesn't stick

1325
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:14,179
[Music] Yeah

Wait, it's not a jerk, who are you?

1330
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,719
Did your son send you? My son [Music]

1331
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:43,480
I'm worried, can you contact me in person?

1332
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:47,699
[MUSIC] Didn't go as planned, going back home

1333
02:10:47,699 --> 02:10:50,659
I want to, I can't go

1334
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:53,840
I guess you don't know how to get out

weapon because of you

1336
02:10:57,659 --> 02:11:00,980
this is a weapon

1337
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:04,460
looks like this

1338
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:16,800
It's said to be enough to explode Jerk to pieces when fully charged.

1339
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:21,239
It requires 1.21gb of power to operate.

1340
02:11:21,239 --> 02:11:24,500
It's just a generator. That's it.

1341
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:27,619
You just need to find a fuse

1342
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:30,619
okay

1343
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:36,800
Now trust me, do you have sheet music?

1344
02:11:39,179 --> 02:11:45,020
Tear it down, I'll help you with this, I'll tear it all up

02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:59,840
another lift

1346
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:06,360
It says 12. I've seen humans wear these costumes.

1347
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:09,300
It was small in size and made a lot of noise

1348
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:13,860
I ran around, but I remember now, thanks to the children, the distance is longer

1349
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:17,699
They were lively, even though it was difficult because of the children, adults love them very much.

1350
02:12:17,699 --> 02:12:19,940
It was like

1351
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:23,880
The chicken said it misses its son, it's the same

1352
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,060
does it mean

1353
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:54,380
Transactions that will jerk because of the noise

1354
02:12:56,280 --> 02:13:00,900
yes good luck believe me

1355
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:01,980
I'll be back soon [Music]

1356
02:13:01,980 --> 02:13:03,980
huh

1357
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:12,260
I think it's going to be a bit tight here.

1358
02:13:12,659 --> 02:13:15,500
I think there will be a lot of kids

1360
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:32,239
What is this vibration sound while charging?

Hey here too thank you thank you thank you

I have to help, man, ask for help

1364
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:06,079
Go away, you have to go up.

1365
02:14:06,179 --> 02:14:09,739
I almost died

1366
02:14:11,699 --> 02:14:14,420
Supporters don't do it right

1367
02:14:20,579 --> 02:14:23,400
That's cool. You turned the generator back on.

1368
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:27,300
I've seen how powerful it is. If you use this, you can get out of here.

Now, how do you use it? Left if right

[Music] uh this is it oh

1381

There is a risk of overheating

Oh, I can't use this much, so I'll save it and use it calmly, right?

The gauge goes up.

1384
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:58,579
I'm going to cut it off and write it, right?

I just need to find one more. Did you eat only one in Momo's apartment bathroom?

In the bathroom of Momo's apartment, it's in your mind

02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:28,760
little waltz

1443
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:47,240
[Music] Spongebob, what SpongeBob?

1444
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:51,859
It feels a bit like bikini city.

1445
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:13,040
[MUSIC] Okay

1446
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:17,000
thank you so much i'm a great musician now

1447
02:23:18,359 --> 02:23:21,859
yes i took it out

1448
02:23:22,859 --> 02:23:26,880
Oh, I can't see it up close, but first of all, with a badge in the shape of a face

1449
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:29,479
I'll have to see it in the light

1450
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:39,660
I can't see it, I missed the note, I want to see it up close, but I can barely see it

1451
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:43,920
I got two of them

1452
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:48,180
I did everything, but I'm filling it up to what percentage here

1453
02:23:48,180 --> 02:23:54,359
I've filled in a few percent now, I've filled it up to 48%, up to 50% here

1454
02:23:54,359 --> 02:23:56,660
should i fill it

1455
02:23:56,700 --> 02:24:00,180
But I think it will be hard to find again.

1456
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:04,319
You look around so much, it's hard to find where you missed something

1457
02:24:04,319 --> 02:24:07,560
I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1458
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:10,319
Let's pass it on. Finding the other one is going to be tough

1459
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:13,800
It seems to be empty in the top row

1460
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:17,240
But where can I check the memory

1461
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:28,880
Ah, you can see it here Ah, there is a clue like this, look carefully.

1462
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:34,140
Where is this?

1463
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:36,500
it's possible

1464
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:41,160
The one in the top row is when I rescued my dad earlier.

1465
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:44,000
I passed by and can't find it again

1466
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:48,420
ah can't ah

1467
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:55,670
I should have gone before I met a lot of mollusks. Oh, it's over.

1468
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:58,819
[music]

1469
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:04,439
I'm going to say that this is your fault

1470
02:25:04,439 --> 02:25:07,280
I should have told you right away

1471
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:09,740
I would have taken it

1472
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:19,260
Momo is waiting for you on the boat. You can go there now, but there is nothing to do here.

1473
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:23,399
I'm done. I'll close the door when you go.

1474
02:25:23,399 --> 02:25:25,800
yes close

1475
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:29,700
No regrets, let's reset it

1476
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:35,120
I don't have anything, shut up, I'm talking nonsense

1477
02:25:43,319 --> 02:25:47,640
But I missed it, so I can't go again. I can go again later.

1478
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:50,540
I wonder if I can't cover it

1479
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,420
uh

1480
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:59,420
I feel the feeling here too, but I don’t feel it

1481
02:26:00,060 --> 02:26:04,160
Oh, I guess I can find a few more here too

1482
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:10,740
Ah, now it's damaged, so I can't take care of it, isn't it?

1483
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:13,100
I guess you're right

1484
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:21,010
[music]

1485
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:30,180
[Music] [Applause]

1486
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:34,040
Ah, when riding a cart in the sewer

1487
02:26:35,399 --> 02:26:38,120
sewer

1488
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:46,280
[music]

1489
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:50,880
It wasn't like I was paying attention while looking at it like this, but I took care of almost everything.

1490
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:54,319
Except for one

1491
02:26:56,760 --> 02:27:00,840
Asari, if you can't find 6 of them

1492
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:04,080
[MUSIC] I would have just done it

1493
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:07,220
Sorry to say it's one

1494
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:16,070
[music]

1495
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:19,880
what

1496
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:23,300
It's a spooky place

1497
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:27,639
[clap]

1498
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:34,760
look at the color of the water on the floor

1499
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:40,680
[music]

1500
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:55,939
Why don't you open it, I have to do something

1501
02:27:59,730 --> 02:28:05,180
[Music] What should I do here

1502
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:10,760
Alien is coming

1503
02:28:11,220 --> 02:28:13,580
big

1504
02:28:15,060 --> 02:28:21,200
Look at the size of the grain, it will come out in a year

1505
02:28:22,380 --> 02:28:25,530
[music]

1506
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:32,819
I forgot ah

1507
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:38,479
pressing the key button

1508
02:28:58,859 --> 02:29:04,379
me [music]

1509
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:07,760
give me a ride

1510
02:29:10,090 --> 02:29:14,459
[music]

1511
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:17,939
I've never been this far from the slums, but here with you

1512
02:29:17,939 --> 02:29:20,520
I'm not afraid this guy

1513
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:24,680
Yes, you trust me a lot

1514
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:30,260
There was a memory even here where there were a lot of pipes, right?

1515
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:37,819
two of these one of this

1516
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:45,020
that's what i was talking about

1517
02:29:53,939 --> 02:29:59,240
When I'm not riding, he won't just pass by, of course I'll give him a ride

1518
02:30:08,220 --> 02:30:10,920
drive fast

1519
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:13,920
Will you be empty [Music]

1520
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:18,309
I mean do it right [Music]

1521
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:39,720
There's jerkers up there too [Music]

1522
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:45,080
I can't hear you

1523
02:30:45,479 --> 02:30:47,660
What

1524
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:54,080
All these old mechanisms are broken. I'll have to open them manually.

1525
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:58,819
how to

1526
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:02,899
[music]

1527
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:10,160
oh this is possible

1528
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:22,200
There's only room for me to go in, ah you keep going

1529
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:24,870
I can't go but I'll find a way

1530
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:27,899
[Music] I was so brave when I found the kids

1531
02:31:27,899 --> 02:31:33,260
Tell me, I wonder if you're brave, my friend

1532
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:39,680
Hey wait, Yana, I need to find my memory.

1533
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:45,740
It's not over, tell me it's not, quickly

1534
02:31:52,819 --> 02:31:56,000
Come with me as you go

1535
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:27,140
Uh, I hate water.

1536
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,060
okay

1537
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:40,460
hey run fast

1538
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,060
and

1539
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:47,989
[music]

1540
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:06,420
hey come in hey come in

1541
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:10,100
Come in, come in, stop if you pass

1542
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:14,060
I had a gap here

1543
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:17,359
what can i do

1544
02:33:18,370 --> 02:33:26,720
[Music] Ah here, I must remember this place

1545
02:33:26,939 --> 02:33:30,380
remind me here

1546
02:33:33,439 --> 02:33:37,260
Hasto System Yes I remember now I ran out of clean water

1547
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:41,460
A gigantic machine that digs deep into the ground supplied water to the city

1548
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:44,880
Like all other resistances, to sustain human life in times of drought

1549
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:47,939
It was a backup. The scientist gave me the blueprint of the water tank.

1550
02:33:47,939 --> 02:33:52,640
It was big enough for a building to fit in.

1551
02:34:00,899 --> 02:34:06,720
It's good if you find something like this I wouldn't have missed it a lot right now

1552
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:10,319
Unless you missed it, no, you only missed one thing, it's a pity

1553
02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:14,520
Say 99% of men, okay?

1554
02:34:31,319 --> 02:34:34,939
This is where the monsters are

1555
02:34:57,420 --> 02:35:00,140
there are many kids

1556
02:35:07,620 --> 02:35:10,939
You wriggle a lot

1557
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:15,260
wait guys

1558
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:20,359
let's not go near

1559
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:38,300
Oh, in advance, should I just head over there and come back?

1560
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:45,439
If I do this here, I am 100% uneasy.

1561
02:35:49,859 --> 02:35:51,920
wait for a sec

1562
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:59,580
Oh wait, it's okay, it's okay

1563
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:02,479
You may not need to use a beam or something.

1564
02:36:05,460 --> 02:36:09,560
Isn't this the sound of Mori hunting?

1565
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:20,479
To know the subject, the subject

1566
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:27,200
need to know the subject

1567
02:36:29,700 --> 02:36:33,840
Oh come in, come on, maybe

I have to explode all of these things for the best taste

1586

This isn't a clue, there's something here

1587
02:39:29,939 --> 02:39:32,840
Why did you kill him

1588
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:38,660
It's not here, I don't think it's here

So I can't eat, I'm sucking honey now

1593
02:40:33,779 --> 02:40:37,160

02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:25,399
here and here is the clue

1601
02:41:25,979 --> 02:41:31,340
It's here, but it's disgusting here too

1602
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:39,740
I want to bring a toothpick

1603
02:41:51,290 --> 02:41:54,459
[clap]

1604
02:41:55,439 --> 02:42:00,859
What are you, what are you doing, what are you doing?

1605
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:08,060
Hey, you can't waste it like that. It's overheating.

1606
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:14,720
how now then

1607
02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:24,800
Oh, that means I can't write anymore. I don't think I can write.

1608
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:36,060
Uh, but wasn't it there? My memory

1609
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:41,399
[Music] No, ah

1610
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:45,680

1611

oh what is this

1615
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:21,719
Oh so young [Music]

1616
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:34,819
Should have done this before it went on

1617
02:43:36,470 --> 02:43:40,859
[Music] What I see

1618
02:43:40,859 --> 02:43:45,880
I'll read the memory.

02:43:45,880 --> 02:43:50,720

1621
02:44:09,319 --> 02:44:12,800
just right

1622
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:20,399
ok close by

1623
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:33,680
Not cats. I like those monsters.

02:44:35,220 --> 02:44:39,300
wake up

1625
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:43,859
This trash guy was just sucking honey. I'm alone in the dark

1626
02:44:43,859 --> 02:44:48,300
I felt like I was back on the network, but you me

1627
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:53,760
I saved it, thank you, friend.

1628
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:56,240
completely destroyed

1629
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:04,160
Hey useless bastard, if that thing gets destroyed

1630
02:45:08,279 --> 02:45:11,600
How much did you work hard to get?

1631
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:16,279
Yep man

1632
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:24,080
good

1633
02:45:29,939 --> 02:45:33,020
Like my really rotten words

1634
02:45:33,899 --> 02:45:39,439
When you smell beyond imagination, at the moment you smell the real smell

1635
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:43,279
When you want to cut your nose

1636
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:52,680
Traveling on the sewer is good. It’s been a while since I saw a guy like you.

1637
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:57,240
You're the one who contacted me, little outsider, right, right, ah, over there outsider

1638
02:45:57,240 --> 02:46:04,460
Voluntarily, he's waiting for me. He's meditating on top of my town. Okay.

This machine The scientist I helped wrote this

1641
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:38,700
Just got sick, this was his last hope, just walk into the machine

1642
02:46:38,700 --> 02:46:41,640
He went in but I wasn't with him

1643
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:46,080
He was alone, he wanted to, he uploaded himself to the computer

1644
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:50,819
Everything changed after that but something went wrong with the upload he

1645
02:46:50,819 --> 02:46:55,080
I've been locked up for years, until the little cat showed up

1646
02:46:55,080 --> 02:46:59,700
You were waiting for me or me

1647
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:06,060
I was like that I was that scientist

1648
02:47:06,060 --> 02:47:09,920
Now did you do this with this robot?

1649
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:13,279
i need a moment

1650
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:18,439

sorry i

I need some time I don't want to talk right now You don't have to talk Go away I'm this

1653
02:47:29,460 --> 02:47:31,819
I'll look at the memory

1654
02:47:31,859 --> 02:47:35,580
Hey, I need to bring a memory

1655
02:47:35,580 --> 02:47:38,580
come out

1656
02:47:39,660 --> 02:47:44,779

I can't talk

Oh, you're still smiling. You like cats.

1662
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:39,920
I still can't talk

1663
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:56,060
I have to do this too

1664
02:48:57,300 --> 02:49:00,620
I mean you have to work hard

1665
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:07,040
I wonder if there is anything to do

1666
02:49:12,479 --> 02:49:16,680
Oh nice to meet you, your face looks like a camera

1667
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:19,040
that's interesting

1668
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:38,160
Oh that's right that's right that's why you can't talk, he's on strike right now

1669
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:40,160
have

1670
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:45,060
Oh right, there must have been parents and friends, but what happened to them?

1671
02:49:45,060 --> 02:49:49,040
I want to open the city, but is there anyone left to save?

1672
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:53,880
That's right, you've found your energy now.

1673
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:55,939
okay

1674
02:49:56,760 --> 02:50:01,920
No, depending on your mood

1675
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:05,340
I need to talk to the npc.

1676
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:08,359
I'm more like a traveler

1677
02:50:09,080 --> 02:50:14,189
what is this [music]

1678
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:17,640
hey

1679
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:23,220
You don't know that you shouldn't disturb those who are doing Transcendental Meditation.

1680
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:26,040
When I got the call, you were with Momo. Nice to meet you at last. Little

1681
02:50:26,040 --> 02:50:29,600
Because you're an outsider, you know momo and chickens

1682
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:33,600
You must be familiar with outsiders. I miss them. When I think of them, my heart

1683
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:36,359
It's convenient. You gave chicken to Momo in the slum.

1684
02:50:36,359 --> 02:50:42,120
I heard you helped me find it. I'm in Midtown right now, even now

1685
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:44,880
If you want to see the outside, go there

1686
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:48,899
I can take you there. I think you were planning to leave the city. Come on.

1687
02:50:48,899 --> 02:50:54,000
I got this and wrote the address on the back of the photo.

1688
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,760
Gotta go up from the little town

1689
02:50:56,760 --> 02:51:00,720
If you succeed, you'll be the first to reach the outside. Good luck.

1690
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:05,240
You won't need it, believe in you

1691
02:51:07,260 --> 02:51:12,060
Yes, I'm sorry I turned off the light earlier, I'm human, maybe the end of the world

1692
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:16,859
I must be human, this is all I have left. A lot of memories have come back, what I forgot

1693
02:51:16,859 --> 02:51:21,540
How long will it be if I find him, my memory

1694
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:25,319
Maybe I can restore it and take you home

1695
02:51:25,319 --> 02:51:28,860
Get more information from your companion or go upstairs to get to Midtown.

There's a number on it [music]

02:51:48,540 --> 02:51:50,779
what is this

1701
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:57,180
You can find one here. It's patterned like this.

1702
02:51:57,180 --> 02:52:00,200
something red on the left

1703
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:04,760
It's a light, it's like there before with the light sofa.

1704
02:52:05,340 --> 02:52:08,120
I think I saw it somewhere

1705
02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:17,760
Nice to meet you actually this food is terrible but eat here

1706
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:21,600
That's all there is to it

1707
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:25,640
It's better to solve it

Do what you want, you did this, that's this, this is right, memory

1715
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:22,200
This language campaign was made entirely from scratch by robot robots. Really.

1716
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:27,540
Awesome I remember what happened when I was on the network Exactly when

1717
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:31,740
I don't know, but at some point all communication started to switch to this symbol.

1718
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:35,399
I've been stuck inside my computer alone for a long time so I understand everything

1719
02:53:35,399 --> 02:53:39,899
I translated every sign and word one by one until I could

1720
02:53:39,899 --> 02:53:44,300
I know their language too, so I want to hear everything they say

1721
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:51,920
Now then, let's talk about everything from the beginning

1722

Were these the first

That's right, let's talk one by one, everyone

02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:07,260
I know there are over 900 types of white paint.

1725
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:10,140
Don't tell me, I'm making my own paint color right now

1726
02:54:10,140 --> 02:54:15,080
I'm going to call it trash brown.

1727

Game clothes 9,536 wins 6 losses

1728
02:54:20,939 --> 02:54:24,120
Actually I'm programmed to win this game, but no one

1729
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:26,540
can't say

1730
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:31,880
Statistically I should have won at least eight times

1731
02:54:59,700 --> 02:55:03,840
Some call it trash but I call it treasure

1732
02:55:03,840 --> 02:55:09,300
Before I opened it, I was a boatbot before I opened it.

1733
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:13,560
I repurposed my body as a hunter. Don't be fooled by that sound, like this arm I just found.

1734
02:55:13,560 --> 02:55:19,640
It might be hard and terrible. A poor friend's rust to peace.

1735
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:24,620
Maybe there's a reason you're here

1736
02:55:24,660 --> 02:55:26,840
something here

1737

got a red plant

1738
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:41,479
Look at these flowers. They're pretty. Maybe there's a robot that will like them.

1739
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:45,979
love flowers

1740
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:49,760
there will be robots

1741
02:55:52,939 --> 02:55:57,920
Am I not sleeping?

1742
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:01,640
Many homeowners

what do you say

1744
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:12,260
I'm whining until you do this

1745
02:56:20,939 --> 02:56:24,479
Since Maine was in the period of deconstructionism, the viewer himself said so

1746
02:56:24,479 --> 02:56:29,399
Maine will definitely be a great artist if she practices elsewhere.

1747
02:56:29,399 --> 02:56:33,420
I love the smell of fresh paint

1748
02:56:33,420 --> 02:56:36,060
You can't smell it for a while, this is so

1749
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:40,560
It's sad so man I know what you smell

1750
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:43,279
I mean it didn't smell

1751
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:49,580
Isn't that electricity everywhere?

1752
02:56:56,479 --> 02:57:01,800
Well hello, it's been a while since anyone visited, except for the damn thing, of course.

1753
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:04,979
Imagine being able to use their power. Run on something like a wheel.

1754
02:57:04,979 --> 02:57:09,020
You're saying you're wasting your potential now

1755
02:57:09,979 --> 02:57:16,500
When I grow up, I want to be like his aunt and be great. I also explore like my aunt.

1756
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:22,040
We wanted to, but the adults wouldn't let us leave the Enter Village.

1757
02:57:23,300 --> 02:57:27,439
I can't because I'm young, it's dangerous

1758
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:40,859
Ah Clementine, the cozy sound of garbage falling

1759
02:57:40,859 --> 02:57:45,000
A sparkling waterfall, no danger, no poetry, no poetry, a happy place now

1760
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:48,960
Listen, the strong concrete that protects me in that womb will also become my grave

1761
02:57:48,960 --> 02:57:52,939
Is it too solemn?

1762
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:57,359
You can't do it, give up

1763
02:57:57,359 --> 02:58:01,040
There is also honey here. Can I get this?

1764
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:05,120
oh right purple plant

1765
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:10,520
Got it, this seems to have some clues

1766
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:18,740
I think I can do something like this after I collect them by color like this

1767
02:58:37,279 --> 02:58:43,340
Find your way from the top of town to Midtown This must be someone

1768
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:48,540
I think there'll be more [music]

1769
02:58:48,540 --> 02:58:51,540
the feeling is

1770
02:58:54,899 --> 02:58:58,860
Not even these guys [Music]

1771
02:59:04,979 --> 02:59:08,720
It seems to come out if I go up more

1772
02:59:15,540 --> 02:59:20,520
Why did I come here? I can't get over it

1773
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:22,880
just

1774
02:59:27,620 --> 02:59:31,220
are you trying to climb

1775
02:59:35,399 --> 02:59:37,880
It's a flower shop

1776
02:59:38,399 --> 02:59:42,600
Hello friend How are you My aunt has a special plant that can live without sunlight.

1777
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:45,180
I know you taught us how to grow it. I have a lot.

1778
02:59:45,180 --> 02:59:51,120
But there aren't many colors, you just need to find a yellow color.

1779
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:56,240
I'll give you one of these, now I'll give you this too

1780
02:59:56,700 --> 03:00:01,279
I'll find yellow and come back. Instead, I need something good, okay

1781
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:05,819
After I got bored, my aunt taught classes here. We did a lot of cool things.

1782
03:00:05,819 --> 03:00:08,180
I learned

1783
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:16,520
The yellow seems to be somewhere

1784
03:00:17,880 --> 03:00:20,779
is it on top

1785
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:25,580
Good morning. Did you get some sleep?

1786
03:00:25,859 --> 03:00:29,600
A little heart

1787
03:00:37,800 --> 03:00:41,100
Ah, I think someone just wrote my name in the Death Note.

1788
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:43,680
I think I live now because I have immunity

1789
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:45,240
just heart

1790
03:00:45,240 --> 03:00:47,479
I was thrilled

1791
03:00:53,760 --> 03:00:56,240
It's here

1792
03:01:01,140 --> 03:01:06,000
I found it all, I found it all

1793
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,899
someone do this

1794
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:15,500
Although I missed a few memories

1795
03:01:18,779 --> 03:01:24,779
I told you, but someone got it for me. It's my favorite color. Thank you.

1796
03:01:24,779 --> 03:01:27,920
Found all my friends thank you so much

1797
03:01:28,330 --> 03:01:31,620
[Music] If I find it all in my head, I'll take the memory

1798
03:01:31,620 --> 03:01:36,840
I'm not giving you the same thing, there's no such thing, please

1799
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:39,660
My appearance, everything, thanks to you, I found all my memories

1800
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:43,580
Thank you, I'll take away the memory.

1801
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:17,640
Where are you? [Music]

1802
03:02:17,640 --> 03:02:21,859
I heard that the aunt is here, or the aunt

1803
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:25,460
I'm going to meet you

1804
03:02:27,740 --> 03:02:30,830
[music]

1805
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:41,720
It's a subway

1806
03:02:46,740 --> 03:02:52,319
This is the subway station. I completely forgot that this type of transportation existed. With this

1807
03:02:52,319 --> 03:02:55,319
You can go anywhere in the city. When people go to work

1808
03:02:55,319 --> 03:02:58,859
I rode it, so did I. I say goodbye to my family at home every morning

1809
03:02:58,859 --> 03:03:01,640
After saying goodbye

1810
03:03:03,180 --> 03:03:06,479
I remember I was doing this for my family but now they're gone

1811
03:03:06,479 --> 03:03:10,380
It was a long time ago [Music]

1812
03:03:10,380 --> 03:03:13,680
Families wanted to see the outside, but now does that mean anything?

1813
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:19,340
what happened to them what happened to everyone

1814
03:03:20,700 --> 03:03:25,760
forget it anyway we're near midtown now

1815
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:30,319
Let's find Clementine. There's a picture of him here.

1816
03:03:30,319 --> 03:03:35,060
Can you show it to the campaign members? Maybe there's a clue.

1817
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:41,880
[Music] Let's take a look around here

1818
03:03:41,880 --> 03:03:45,479
Stop. I found all the flowers. Who am I?

1819
03:03:45,479 --> 03:03:51,439
Yes, it's a cozy room where you can feel the purple light

1820
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:55,600
[MUSIC] Then

1821
03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:59,040
[Music] I don't know what

1822
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:04,260
I don't know what the red graffiti is.

1823
03:04:04,260 --> 03:04:09,140
I don't know what it is, something blue screen pops up here

1824
03:04:10,380 --> 03:04:17,450
Table End End End End End [Music]

1825
03:04:22,439 --> 03:04:25,560
uh [music]

1826
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:28,160
is not it

1827
03:04:31,979 --> 03:04:34,160
books

1828
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:38,720
It's not here, it's going up

1829
03:04:38,880 --> 03:04:42,920
Memory Let me know if I missed anything If I think I'm missing something

1830
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:47,040
At least 97% of men should keep it. I think there might be one here.

1831
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:49,939
this is

1832
03:04:53,939 --> 03:04:58,319
There are so many books here. The Turing Test Legacy The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence

1833
03:04:58,319 --> 03:05:01,620
There's something I know, did I have a bibliography

1834
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:05,460
The smell of the book and the feeling of turning the pages I remember it as very unique, almost comfortable

1835
03:05:05,460 --> 03:05:09,540
It was like a feeling. A book is like spending time with someone.

1836
03:05:09,540 --> 03:05:12,020
It was like

1837
03:05:20,180 --> 03:05:25,700
I have no words, I know this, I can’t say it

1838
03:05:25,700 --> 03:05:30,740
[Music] Can't talk

1839
03:05:35,210 --> 03:05:40,920
[Applause] And

1840
03:05:40,920 --> 03:05:45,260
It's noisy, I paid a charter

1841
03:05:45,660 --> 03:05:48,500
I'm counting

1842
03:05:49,020 --> 03:05:52,640
They're playing songs like this on the street corner

1843
03:06:09,479 --> 03:06:12,200
There must be police robots too

1844
03:06:13,380 --> 03:06:15,740
police logo

1845
03:06:19,380 --> 03:06:25,670
nice to meet you [music]

1846
03:06:26,520 --> 03:06:29,220
I already told you five times

1847
03:06:29,220 --> 03:06:33,359
They said you shouldn't run around like that. It's dangerous. Hey, I've never seen a robot like this before.

1848
03:06:33,359 --> 03:06:37,920
Bukchibuk Era Boineai Wanted The woman on the screen is different

1849
03:06:37,920 --> 03:06:42,080
Ask me, I'm busy here because of Yoshi, so I don't know anything

1850
03:06:45,479 --> 03:06:50,220
Don't worry about the garbage, we'll take care of it all here

1851
03:06:50,220 --> 03:06:56,840
If you plan to eat all of the batch, even if you are just doing something

1852
03:06:59,100 --> 03:07:04,040
I'll transfer the newspaper to jail and reboot

1853
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:09,660
Even if you leave me alone, I'm not the one you're looking for

1854
03:07:09,660 --> 03:07:13,140
If you're looking for Clementine, she'll be hiding in the residential area.

1855
03:07:13,140 --> 03:07:16,399
Can you tell me in detail

1856
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:34,439
If I didn't know if there was a place like this for no reason, I hid something here.

1857
03:07:34,439 --> 03:07:36,740
because

1858
03:07:45,740 --> 03:07:48,920
is there anything

1859
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:56,660
Developer Eva, nothing here

1860
03:07:56,939 --> 03:08:01,220
I made empathy for no reason, so I made people confused

1861
03:08:07,100 --> 03:08:11,399
Lower floors have restricted access due to dangerous organic life.

1862
03:08:11,399 --> 03:08:16,399
Don't tell me, I've already been there

1863
03:08:21,660 --> 03:08:26,939
I can hear the sound down here

1864
03:08:26,939 --> 03:08:30,120
Clementine: We used to hang out together, but I want to leave.

1865
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:34,319
I did it, it was like a breeze and it flew away, now I'm wanted

1866
03:08:34,319 --> 03:08:37,740
Sounded too heavy for me

1867
03:08:37,740 --> 03:08:40,220
ebb and flow

1868
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:48,859
There's a memory on this side.

1869
03:08:50,399 --> 03:08:54,060
Even if you don't tell me, I know where you are

1870
03:08:54,060 --> 03:08:56,479
don't talk

1871
03:08:57,899 --> 03:09:02,120
what to do inside

1872
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:14,960
Wow, Midtown is also looking for something like a vending machine

1873
03:09:16,020 --> 03:09:21,260
But if you eat carefully, you'll find it

1874
03:09:24,840 --> 03:09:28,279
If you look closely without missing anything

1875
03:09:36,800 --> 03:09:41,000
Oh, he must work for a cleaning company here.

1876
03:09:42,560 --> 03:09:46,380
There is an address after uh, the first symbol is the street name and then

1877
03:09:46,380 --> 03:09:52,020
Next is the floor and door number. Street floor door number.

1878
03:09:52,020 --> 03:09:54,500
it will be easy to find

1879
03:09:57,859 --> 03:10:01,160
oh not me

1880
03:10:03,180 --> 03:10:06,060
Street floor number No, what did you say earlier? Street

1881
03:10:06,060 --> 03:10:12,200
What did 3rd floor 5 on the blue street say?

1882
03:10:19,570 --> 03:10:23,520
[MUSIC] Door number

1883
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:27,439
It's blue, but the door number is 5 on the 3rd floor. Okay

1884
03:10:27,439 --> 03:10:30,620
may be many

1885
03:10:30,899 --> 03:10:34,140
This scammer sold a defective battery

1886
03:10:34,140 --> 03:10:37,140
If you try to argue, you pretend not to hear me

1887
03:10:37,140 --> 03:10:41,479
This swindler, who was not a Sentinel in pure blood, must have been disbanded as a bupo

1888
03:10:41,939 --> 03:10:44,340
I can get in

1889
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:48,500
Even if the kids go in, they don’t say anything, that’s the case here

1890
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:57,180
uh safe what is digcode

This is luminous, there is even luminous noise, noise

1900
03:11:53,279 --> 03:11:59,819
There is also a completely rare legend league.

1901
03:11:59,819 --> 03:12:02,720
It also has a glitch effect.

1902
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:07,399
a handsome cat

1903
03:12:09,840 --> 03:12:14,779
Should I go in here first? Is this the beginning?

1904
03:12:16,200 --> 03:12:19,819
I don't know if there's anything else

1905
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:25,439
Sorry kid you can't play here this factory is for money hairballs like you

1906
03:12:25,439 --> 03:12:27,720
It's not a place. Enemies are limited, but only for a while.

1907
03:12:27,720 --> 03:12:31,920
That's it, if you wait a few years, it will open right away. A few years.

1908
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:34,920
is the distance

1909
03:12:56,819 --> 03:13:03,439
Are you hiding and entering? I’m busy right now, why are you calling me?

1910
03:13:09,620 --> 03:13:15,020
Later, when you're being chased, I'll see what you're doing in hiding

1911
03:13:15,479 --> 03:13:17,479
Right

1912
03:13:19,439 --> 03:13:22,340
What are you doing hiding?

1913
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:26,479
What are you

1914
03:13:30,540 --> 03:13:35,359
Who are you? All the cops are holding you that day. Then you didn’t come here.

1915
03:13:48,080 --> 03:13:53,399
It smells like memory here, isn't it?

1916
03:13:55,210 --> 03:14:01,859
[MUSIC] I've been to the city below, there

1917
03:14:01,859 --> 03:14:03,779
I have a friend called pp

1918
03:14:03,779 --> 03:14:07,800
I haven't seen the article for a long time PP Did we see it too?

1919
03:14:07,800 --> 03:14:10,760
who is pp pp

1920
03:14:11,170 --> 03:14:17,459
[music]

1921
03:14:30,180 --> 03:14:33,620
oh what is here

1922
03:14:39,300 --> 03:14:43,080
I don't know what the heck they say downstairs.

1923
03:14:43,080 --> 03:14:45,080
I can hear

1924
03:14:46,500 --> 03:14:49,819
I'm here to hear this

1925
03:14:55,020 --> 03:14:57,739
uh what is this

1926
03:14:59,040 --> 03:15:01,340
ghost

1927
03:15:08,970 --> 03:15:12,090
[music]

1928
03:15:16,319 --> 03:15:20,000
uh here it is nice

1929
03:15:24,120 --> 03:15:28,140
I like it here, on the soft pillow and on the cool drink

1930
03:15:28,140 --> 03:15:31,260
How nice it would be if I could actually taste it

1931
03:15:31,260 --> 03:15:35,100
The drone is useful, but I miss my body, I miss the feeling, being sick and hungry

1932
03:15:35,100 --> 03:15:38,220
And I know it's no use, but here's a little bit

1933
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:41,060
can't you stay longer

1934
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:54,080
Nothing difficult

1935
03:16:02,700 --> 03:16:05,300
Spread the diaper

1936
03:16:08,220 --> 03:16:11,899
Ah, I really want to live like a cat too

1937
03:16:12,060 --> 03:16:14,899
envious friend

1938
03:16:15,060 --> 03:16:19,800
I've run a bar, it's the coziest place here on my lap

1939
03:16:19,800 --> 03:16:24,020
Until I put the screwdriver in. Now the door is closed.

1940
03:16:25,880 --> 03:16:31,399
Makes me angry, but my only customer drives me away

1941
03:16:39,060 --> 03:16:44,040
You guys are not so cool right now, it's really okay

1942
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:46,880
I don't think it's harmful

1943
03:16:47,160 --> 03:16:50,819
Inside the nuance of smoking, it's a robot I know. I've seen it often. I live around here.

1944
03:16:50,819 --> 03:16:53,939
I don't remember how you always talked about leaving the city.

1945
03:16:53,939 --> 03:16:57,920
It's a good place, why are you leaving?

1946
03:17:03,779 --> 03:17:08,060
Oh, there's a hologram here too

1947
03:17:09,899 --> 03:17:13,760
wake up oh what

1948
03:17:19,800 --> 03:17:24,800
I'm suddenly up and screaming

1949
03:17:26,320 --> 03:17:30,309
[music]

1950
03:17:38,880 --> 03:17:43,939
I then came out here and then

1951
03:17:46,979 --> 03:17:50,899
This looks like a restaurant bar

1952
03:17:51,540 --> 03:17:55,080
[Music] I'm trying to win first place in this game

1953
03:17:55,080 --> 03:17:59,040
I was going to download it, but there was a malicious code. I don't know why, but now

1954
03:17:59,040 --> 03:18:01,939
everything looks weird

1955
03:18:02,340 --> 03:18:05,399
I have mastered every game in existence but how this works

1956
03:18:05,399 --> 03:18:10,040
I can't understand. I can't see the big picture.

1957
03:18:10,439 --> 03:18:13,319
You seem to be gathering information about ancient machines, so you're a weird girl. Ah, you have this too

1958
03:18:13,319 --> 03:18:15,739
no maybe

1959
03:18:31,160 --> 03:18:36,120
Hey, the song is much better, but I’m casual

1960
03:18:36,120 --> 03:18:40,580
I don't know ton-in, but I like almost everything

1961
03:18:40,580 --> 03:18:45,859
The picture came out well, it's all the same story

1962
03:18:48,170 --> 03:18:53,470
[MUSIC] I thought I was cooking something

1963
03:18:53,470 --> 03:18:56,700
[music]

1964
03:18:58,319 --> 03:19:02,840
My favorite drink is oil. What do you like?

1965
03:19:04,940 --> 03:19:09,859
[MUSIC] Like that

1966
03:19:10,620 --> 03:19:14,000
I think there is something

1967
03:19:18,840 --> 03:19:21,739
what could be

1968
03:19:37,130 --> 03:19:40,370
[clap]

1969
03:19:47,279 --> 03:19:53,520
What can I do here? Is this a barber shop?

1970
03:19:53,520 --> 03:19:58,620
It looks like it's not a barber shop, it's just that

1971
03:19:58,739 --> 03:20:02,100
Friends, I've been here once. Why are you asking?

1972
03:20:02,100 --> 03:20:05,880
When you exit my store, there is a residence area to the right.

1973
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:13,460
If you go right, you can go right up there.

1974
03:20:15,239 --> 03:20:17,779
how

1975
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:27,140
Ah, what is it? Teleportation

1976
03:20:34,439 --> 03:20:37,220
Oh here

1977
03:20:41,300 --> 03:20:45,720
The barbershop was a social block where people gathered to talk, joke, and tell secrets.

1978
03:20:45,720 --> 03:20:49,439
We shared. It was a fun place. Even after the humans disappeared, the campaigns continued.

1979
03:20:49,439 --> 03:20:53,160
Keeping the shop up

1980
03:20:53,160 --> 03:20:57,720
What's the difference between the fact that it's not

1981
03:20:57,720 --> 03:21:00,439
Come to think of it

1982
03:21:01,739 --> 03:21:04,939
Oh what a screw

1983
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:07,819
what is the feeling

1984
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:18,620
It looks like they're selling cotton swabs here

1985
03:21:22,200 --> 03:21:27,080
If you go out and go to the right, you will see that the residential area is the residential area.

1986
03:21:34,739 --> 03:21:37,520
ah nice to meet you

1987
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:45,319
What should I make tonight Chef, do you know this?

1988
03:21:45,359 --> 03:21:49,020
You can't pay real money. Money.

1989
03:21:49,020 --> 03:21:51,020
[music] hey

1990
03:21:51,020 --> 03:21:55,680
Because you said nonsense, what is this?

1991
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:58,760
oh here too

1992
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:02,700
Hey, this is a bit real, it will come out if you just walk around

1993
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:05,880
That's right, robots imitate human work and behavior.

1994
03:22:05,880 --> 03:22:11,760
It's interesting, I think they sell burgers and street food here

1995
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:14,460
Do you remember where you most wanted to go when you were a human?

1996
03:22:14,460 --> 03:22:17,880
It's small but friendly, I can't remember the waiter's name, it started with m

1997
03:22:17,880 --> 03:22:20,000
looks like

1998
03:22:29,450 --> 03:22:34,260
[Music] Should I switch?

1999
03:22:34,859 --> 03:22:39,660
My friend Sentinel runs into it, but those evil guys took my friend Pablo.

2000
03:22:39,660 --> 03:22:43,200
I'm doing a 350-year-old community history meeting.

2001
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:47,160
But these guys don't die anyway, are the boring times the same?

2002
03:22:47,160 --> 03:22:51,120
All I could do was walk near the elevator, but Centy screamed. For years we were

2003
03:22:51,120 --> 03:22:54,899
I lived with the saying that I couldn't live on the surface

2004
03:22:54,899 --> 03:22:59,660
We accepted it as fact, but why

2005
03:23:03,930 --> 03:23:08,769
[music]

2006
03:23:09,540 --> 03:23:13,220
Shall we go once? How will it come out?

2007
03:23:18,600 --> 03:23:22,220
I don't think I need to go now

2008
03:23:22,500 --> 03:23:26,660
I think it's better to talk to Clementine.

2009
03:23:31,880 --> 03:23:35,779
There doesn't seem to be any vending machine elements.

2010
03:23:50,520 --> 03:23:55,920
I'm sorry, this is a clothing store. You also play loud music all day.

2011
03:23:55,920 --> 03:23:58,680
Don't touch anything with the guys who listen Don't be loud

2012
03:23:58,680 --> 03:24:01,399
Unexpected

2013
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:08,479
to choose harshly

2014
03:24:13,500 --> 03:24:16,040
Looks like a locker room

2015
03:24:22,380 --> 03:24:25,580
what is insert item

2016
03:24:26,520 --> 03:24:29,840
I think you can do it with some kind of tape

2017
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:54,200
Uh, you're just coming here, what, I thought there was something

2018
03:25:02,880 --> 03:25:05,600
here for some reason

2019
03:25:17,819 --> 03:25:21,899
How far do you go?

2020
03:25:21,899 --> 03:25:24,020
tired

2021
03:25:24,600 --> 03:25:26,899
I blink

2022
03:25:27,060 --> 03:25:31,100
Nice

2023
03:25:31,979 --> 03:25:36,120
Where did you go? Police patch Oh, is this it?

2024
03:25:36,120 --> 03:25:40,080
That's right, the one I just got next to the neon sign

2025
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:42,800
there is a gold color

2026
03:25:51,840 --> 03:25:57,439
Do I need to go to the corner after that?

2027
03:26:00,899 --> 03:26:03,560
I can't go in

2028
03:26:05,220 --> 03:26:08,880
I'm shedding bloody tears [music]

2029
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:13,100
Sentinel go to hell Long live the outsider

2030
03:26:16,319 --> 03:26:21,600
I can't stand it. Give me some food for the cat.

2031
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:27,319
I want to feed you, but I have nothing to eat

2032
03:26:35,359 --> 03:26:39,779
It's the trendiest store in Midtown, but the owner of the store is pretty nasty.

2033
03:26:39,779 --> 03:26:42,140
It was trash

2034
03:26:44,939 --> 03:26:47,180
It's trash

2035
03:26:47,700 --> 03:26:52,700
uh sorry uh what is this what is this what is it

2036
03:26:57,620 --> 03:27:02,220
Oops, oops, I don't think there are pockets or anything.

2037
03:27:02,220 --> 03:27:07,500
Oh sorry sorry [music]

2038
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:10,040
sorry

2039
03:27:12,960 --> 03:27:16,760
Oh, you said go away

2040
03:27:20,899 --> 03:27:25,939
I have to go to the third floor of the residential area here.

2041
03:27:26,580 --> 03:27:30,800
this asshole we can see you too

2042
03:27:31,040 --> 03:27:35,899
Ah, I was talking about watching CCTV.

2043
03:27:44,160 --> 03:27:48,359
Life has become boring since Centre installed a camera in our house.

2044
03:27:48,359 --> 03:27:52,500
Watch one Bonaire

2045
03:27:52,500 --> 03:27:55,979
you can't steal

2046
03:27:56,700 --> 03:28:00,660
If you do something with Tintin and Miko and something on me, I can give you one security

2047
03:28:00,660 --> 03:28:05,220
I installed the camera generation, ok

2048
03:28:05,220 --> 03:28:09,260
okay okay enough enough

2049
03:28:09,779 --> 03:28:12,200
not enough

2050
03:28:16,040 --> 03:28:22,520
If you turn off the 3 security cameras, they will give you a tape.

2051
03:28:23,399 --> 03:28:27,859
Where was it? I saw it before, which store was it at?

2052
03:28:27,960 --> 03:28:31,399
What store were you in?

2053
03:28:35,399 --> 03:28:39,300
What does it mean to lose an out shop character sheet?

2054
03:28:39,300 --> 03:28:43,700
So, I've been preparing for this session all week.

2055
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:49,819
I'm sorry, I forgot where I put it. Let's do that.

2056
03:28:50,460 --> 03:28:53,420
I mean do it right

2057
03:28:53,939 --> 03:28:58,620
This is all right, that was 3 earlier

2058
03:28:58,620 --> 03:29:04,500
Inverted triangle 3 and 5 35 OK, this is the second floor. That’s the third floor. On the third floor.

2059
03:29:04,500 --> 03:29:08,899
It's room 5. It's room 5 on the 3rd floor.

2060
03:29:13,819 --> 03:29:18,060
ok i like it

2061
03:29:18,060 --> 03:29:20,300
he did it too

2062
03:29:22,020 --> 03:29:24,920
A Nice

2063
03:29:25,140 --> 03:29:27,500
I like it

2064
03:29:28,020 --> 03:29:32,000
Now I just need to do two more, just two more

2065
03:29:37,260 --> 03:29:43,500
On the way down, on the way up, before going up

2066
03:29:43,500 --> 03:29:47,960
Do a little more research and see what

2067
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:51,140
The way up here too

2068
03:29:55,200 --> 03:30:00,380
I just need to find two more CCTVs. There's one over there.

2069
03:30:01,920 --> 03:30:05,239
I have to step on the steps to get over it.

2070
03:30:06,779 --> 03:30:09,620
there's one here too

2071
03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:20,779
Okay, but can I just remove this?

2072
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:28,760
Then I wrote it down, this is

2073
03:30:30,380 --> 03:30:33,620
I'm not coming

2074
03:30:36,420 --> 03:30:39,439
okay bring it

2075
03:30:41,530 --> 03:30:45,779
[Applause] Cassette tape

2076
03:30:45,779 --> 03:30:49,499
Got it [Applause]

2077
03:30:49,560 --> 03:30:53,060
Enjoy our song, you will like it

2078
03:30:56,880 --> 03:30:59,939
You're dancing before you go

2079
03:30:59,939 --> 03:31:04,220
Let's go to a clothing store first and insert a cassette tape for a song

2080
03:31:11,560 --> 03:31:20,700
[Music] What is this?

2081
03:31:21,650 --> 03:31:28,799
[music]

2082
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:34,279
what

2083
03:31:35,880 --> 03:31:42,610
Damn how do you turn this off uh what are you doing when he's looking away?

2084
03:31:42,610 --> 03:31:47,760
[Music] A jacket

2085
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:53,080
Steal A Nice [Music]

2086
03:31:56,700 --> 03:32:01,920
This is the jacket we stole from the store.

2087
03:32:01,920 --> 03:32:08,540
It must be used when infiltrating. Now let's go see Clementine.

2088
03:32:11,760 --> 03:32:14,840
3rd floor room 5

2089
03:32:16,080 --> 03:32:19,700
3rd floor 2 3

2090
03:32:20,460 --> 03:32:22,460
4

2091
03:32:23,939 --> 03:32:27,319
It's the only way for cats to enter.

2092
03:32:43,260 --> 03:32:46,760
Are you here Clementine

2093
03:32:47,479 --> 03:32:53,779
What is it, be careful

2094
03:32:53,960 --> 03:32:57,359
Uh you're not strong, don't mind who you are

2095
03:32:57,359 --> 03:33:00,260
what do you want this

2096
03:33:00,420 --> 03:33:05,160
Wait, he finally decided to send someone. Are you my new recruit?

2097
03:33:05,160 --> 03:33:07,979
You see, I'm not very tall, how can I?

2098
03:33:07,979 --> 03:33:12,239
You passed, you're quite talented. Ever since I left Ent Village,

2099
03:33:12,239 --> 03:33:15,060
I've been looking for a way to the outside but the Sentinel is always

2100
03:33:15,060 --> 03:33:17,399
I watched

2101
03:33:17,399 --> 03:33:19,640
follow me

2102
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:27,380
I think there must be something here. There must be a reason why it came out of here

2103
03:33:27,580 --> 03:33:37,020
[music] uh

2104
03:33:37,020 --> 03:33:44,860
no [music]

2105
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:48,800
floating point

2106
03:33:52,140 --> 03:33:54,979
there are many here

2107
03:33:58,260 --> 03:34:01,260
is it a hideout

2108
03:34:08,939 --> 03:34:11,840
no it's not

2109
03:34:14,580 --> 03:34:18,080
I thought there was something

2110
03:34:18,359 --> 03:34:21,920
It was just a healing space

2111
03:34:25,439 --> 03:34:27,920
where should have gone

2112
03:34:29,120 --> 03:34:32,340
I plan to use this old subway these days

2113
03:34:32,340 --> 03:34:37,200
I'm standing up. I've got a key to start it. All I need is an atom to power it up.

2114
03:34:37,200 --> 03:34:41,939
It's just the battery

2115
03:34:43,859 --> 03:34:48,500
I don't know the name, Boomerzki is a robot wearing a gold chain.

2116
03:34:49,979 --> 03:34:53,580
If I was quick like you, I would sneak into the factory.

2117
03:34:53,580 --> 03:34:55,939
there will be no problem

2118
03:35:00,120 --> 03:35:02,239
necklace

2119
03:35:02,340 --> 03:35:05,760
Is he the guy who told me to quit earlier? He looked a bit hip, but he

2120
03:35:05,760 --> 03:35:07,939
is not it

2121
03:35:10,020 --> 03:35:14,399
You're right, where did you get this from?

2122
03:35:14,399 --> 03:35:18,620
For some reason, there was nothing cheap

2123
03:35:20,880 --> 03:35:25,560
The battery is supplying power to that factory, but the whole is a restricted area.

2124
03:35:25,560 --> 03:35:29,580
I'm pouring it thoroughly, I sent it back if it wasn't an employee

2125
03:35:29,580 --> 03:35:32,540
but who am i

2126
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:38,000
Oh, you should also bring a worker's helmet. A jacket and

2127
03:35:38,040 --> 03:35:42,319
I have a helmet or a jacket, but I don't have a helmet.

2128
03:35:42,319 --> 03:35:48,380
Take a good look at the central intersection. Oh, it's here.

2129
03:35:49,439 --> 03:35:52,140
No one can enter the store while it is being restocked.

2130
03:35:52,140 --> 03:35:55,439
If you think about incompetence, it will probably take a long time

2131
03:35:55,439 --> 03:35:58,439
Uh huh

2132
03:36:22,439 --> 03:36:24,239
It's not him, it's not him

2133
03:36:24,239 --> 03:36:29,239
I can't remember the name, there was a space here too

2134
03:36:29,760 --> 03:36:36,560
It looks like him. Should I wake him up? It looks like he's going up and dropping something.

2135
03:36:41,520 --> 03:36:46,279
Hey wake up I'm looking for you guys

2136
03:36:46,620 --> 03:36:49,220
I have to go to work soon

2137
03:36:49,500 --> 03:36:52,279
I'm going

2138
03:36:52,439 --> 03:36:55,040
hey i brought a friend

2139
03:37:05,220 --> 03:37:08,540
what time is the time

2140
03:37:08,960 --> 03:37:14,840
I'm insane, I'm sorry, I was drinking a little

2141
03:37:18,540 --> 03:37:21,560
okay nice

2142
03:37:21,779 --> 03:37:24,920
let's go in let's go in

2143
03:37:32,880 --> 03:37:36,260
where is the hat

2144
03:37:43,560 --> 03:37:46,520
go out go out

2145
03:37:48,660 --> 03:37:52,300
ok nice came out

2146
03:37:52,300 --> 03:37:57,440
[music]

2147
03:37:58,620 --> 03:38:01,340
I want to look back for a moment

2148
03:38:04,200 --> 03:38:07,939
Uh, you look like a janitor

2149
03:38:08,580 --> 03:38:11,580
yes let's go

2150
03:38:13,939 --> 03:38:20,540
Shouldn't I take off the necklace? It's too flex.

2151
03:38:21,750 --> 03:38:24,860
[music]

2152
03:38:28,520 --> 03:38:32,790
[Music] Take off the necklace

2153
03:38:32,790 --> 03:38:40,049
[music]

2154
03:38:40,199 --> 03:38:45,319
Shouldn't I look inside the box? I guess I only see the label on the outside

2155
03:38:46,220 --> 03:38:49,320
[music]

2156
03:38:52,340 --> 03:38:56,399
[music]

2157
03:39:14,120 --> 03:39:19,100
You have to leave when it's safe, don't know what will pass

2158
03:39:29,220 --> 03:39:32,410
[music]

2159
03:39:53,110 --> 03:39:58,590
[Music] Alright alright

2160
03:39:58,590 --> 03:40:17,010
[music]

2161
03:40:41,279 --> 03:40:44,840
Oh, must I go the opposite way?

2162
03:41:00,800 --> 03:41:06,660
[MUSIC] Follow the shadows

2163
03:41:06,660 --> 03:41:09,770
[music]

2164
03:41:19,710 --> 03:41:23,090
[music]

2165
03:41:32,020 --> 03:41:35,110
[music]

2166
03:41:53,939 --> 03:41:58,520
There is no such thing as a very genius cat

2167
03:42:01,900 --> 03:42:05,090
[music]

2168
03:42:09,560 --> 03:42:13,880
Is it in the center, is it an atomic battery, is that

2169
03:42:14,830 --> 03:42:18,379
[music]

2170
03:42:39,660 --> 03:42:43,279
Are you placing one

2171
03:42:49,319 --> 03:42:52,939
Oh, I'm bringing this here

2172
03:43:01,340 --> 03:43:10,540
[music]

2173
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:22,469
[music]

2174
03:43:23,220 --> 03:43:27,020
I can step on one yet

2175
03:43:30,020 --> 03:43:38,790
[music]

2176
03:43:40,140 --> 03:43:44,660
oh ok you can bring it

2177
03:43:45,420 --> 03:43:50,399
You should bring it. It's an alien object. You should bring it.

2178
03:43:50,399 --> 03:43:54,260
No, can I step on this

2179
03:43:59,250 --> 03:44:02,399
[music]

2180
03:44:02,819 --> 03:44:05,479
okay

2181
03:44:10,810 --> 03:44:14,150
[Music] It bounced, can I just bounce quickly?

2182
03:44:14,150 --> 03:44:18,359
[MUSIC] Here the facility has stopped

2183
03:44:18,359 --> 03:44:23,520
I did it with my batteries. I need to get out before the cents show up.

2184
03:44:23,520 --> 03:44:26,300
We have to go to Clemental.

2185
03:44:35,100 --> 03:44:42,500
Oh, I solved the puzzle too lightly.

2186
03:44:43,680 --> 03:44:48,600
The way out is good, the way in is tough, but the way out is fast.

2187
03:44:48,600 --> 03:44:51,739
Sentinel blocked it

2188
03:44:51,960 --> 03:44:56,760
Are you dancing even when you go out? Even if you guys can steal our place

2189
03:44:56,760 --> 03:45:00,080
Can't steal our moves

2190
03:45:01,620 --> 03:45:04,939
I can't dance, there's no point

2191
03:45:05,880 --> 03:45:10,340
Put it on. I think it will all be solved if you block our block.

2192
03:45:11,279 --> 03:45:15,080
Are criminals targeting my vintage card collection?

2193
03:45:15,080 --> 03:45:19,340
All of this has become futile

2194
03:45:19,620 --> 03:45:23,359
I'm home, there's always a way to get in

2195
03:45:40,140 --> 03:45:42,979
king's power

2196
03:45:52,260 --> 03:45:55,580
I think I can just go in

2197
03:46:02,359 --> 03:46:05,540
It's absurd

2198
03:46:06,660 --> 03:46:09,979
I'm dumbfounded

2199
03:46:10,580 --> 03:46:13,700
[music]

2200
03:46:18,430 --> 03:46:26,409
[music]

2201
03:46:29,090 --> 03:46:32,309
[music]

2202
03:46:36,420 --> 03:46:39,560
have to go the other way

2203
03:46:50,819 --> 03:46:53,300
here

2204
03:46:57,020 --> 03:47:01,379
[clap]

2205
03:47:02,040 --> 03:47:05,520
I was surprised, I didn't know you were on the other side

2206
03:47:05,520 --> 03:47:16,169
[music]

2207
03:47:17,340 --> 03:47:21,380
Oh stop, just watch something one by one

2208
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:23,960
uh

2209
03:47:25,960 --> 03:47:32,360
[Music] It's here

2210
03:47:32,360 --> 03:47:34,399
[MUSIC] Hi

2211
03:47:56,479 --> 03:48:00,080
Be quiet if you go here

2212
03:48:06,359 --> 03:48:09,960
ok hey

2213
03:48:10,160 --> 03:48:13,250
[music]

2214
03:48:17,279 --> 03:48:19,699
Where are you

2215
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:27,260
I hid above you. I was finally on my way here.

2216
03:48:31,739 --> 03:48:34,340
where is clementine

2217
03:48:39,720 --> 03:48:42,020
where did you go

2218
03:48:42,779 --> 03:48:45,439
Are you pooping in the bathroom?

2219
03:48:45,779 --> 03:48:48,500
where did clementine go

2220
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:57,439
Look at the clue board

2221
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:11,760
The answer is in my stuff and there are 4 climates The answer is in my stuff

2222
03:49:11,760 --> 03:49:14,479
There are 4 symbols

2223
03:49:16,699 --> 03:49:21,439
OK potted jewelry

planter jewelry vase

2225
03:49:27,180 --> 03:49:30,920
This is one too, isn't this?

2226
03:49:31,470 --> 03:49:35,819
[MUSIC] I found something, I can't see anything

2227
03:49:35,819 --> 03:49:37,939
surely

2228
03:49:41,699 --> 03:49:44,760
three first pots

2229
03:49:44,760 --> 03:49:50,580
The second one is not a conical hat, but what is the second jewel and the last one?

2230
03:49:50,580 --> 03:49:55,880
It looks exactly like this

2231
03:50:08,600 --> 03:50:12,540
My sensor can only detect chemicals that are harmless in the gaseous state.

2232
03:50:12,540 --> 03:50:15,300
I can't limit the feeling of whether it was comfortable to remember

2233
03:50:15,300 --> 03:50:18,060
The camperion can't smell like me, so why?

2234
03:50:18,060 --> 03:50:22,620
A message is hidden even under the courage

2235
03:50:26,350 --> 03:50:29,499
[music]

2236
03:50:30,920 --> 03:50:35,060
Because there is a hint clue in the house

2237
03:50:35,220 --> 03:50:39,180
What is it? It's in an apartment. It's really strange.

2238
03:50:39,180 --> 03:50:43,739
I don't have anything

2239
03:50:43,739 --> 03:50:48,899
Ah, there's something left here Nightclub Uh this is it

2240
03:50:48,899 --> 03:50:53,939
Kkokkalcon Nightclub

2241
03:50:56,540 --> 03:51:02,279
I'd be up here as a nightclub nightclub

2242
03:51:02,279 --> 03:51:04,640
unless it's something

2243
03:51:04,640 --> 03:51:08,540
There can't be room above

2244
03:51:11,939 --> 03:51:14,479
this is it

2245
03:51:15,570 --> 03:51:19,920
[MUSIC] Ah

2246
03:51:19,920 --> 03:51:24,020
I'm with the blazer

2247
03:51:26,399 --> 03:51:30,260
If you find them all, I'll put together the order now.

2248
03:51:33,960 --> 03:51:38,699
Oh, is this the first one then this is right

2249
03:51:38,699 --> 03:51:42,260
I guess it was the expression of incense.

2250
03:51:43,020 --> 03:51:49,279
I saw that the last one didn't open

2251
03:51:49,439 --> 03:51:53,300
Above all of this, not this

2252
03:52:09,899 --> 03:52:15,319
OK Night Club

2253
03:52:23,340 --> 03:52:28,520
Can't you go down comfortably?

[music]

2255
03:52:40,199 --> 03:52:42,600
Oh, you're having a hard time [Music]

2256
03:52:42,600 --> 03:52:44,600
huh

2257
03:52:49,140 --> 03:52:52,699
It's a place that has nothing to do with you, go away

2258
03:52:57,239 --> 03:53:01,460
I think I will have to go back

2259
03:53:06,779 --> 03:53:09,910
I think I have to climb back

2260
03:53:09,910 --> 03:53:20,939
[MUSIC] I can get into the club

2261
03:53:20,939 --> 03:53:24,800
Gil is such a kid here

2262
03:53:30,199 --> 03:53:33,500
what are you doing

2263
03:53:37,540 --> 03:53:40,869
[music]

2264
03:53:44,460 --> 03:53:47,060
what one

2265
03:53:50,819 --> 03:53:53,300
hello how are you

2266
03:53:55,439 --> 03:53:58,460
have i seen him

2267
03:54:02,460 --> 03:54:05,300
Pretend you're cursing

2268
03:54:09,120 --> 03:54:13,939
I need to find my way into the club

2269
03:54:14,200 --> 03:54:20,120
[Music] Where is this

2270
03:54:21,979 --> 03:54:29,300
If you go into the central yellow bell cow, you will find it. Oh this

2271
03:54:31,500 --> 03:54:36,420
Uh, this place was originally closed. That's right.

2272
03:54:36,420 --> 03:54:40,939
It was closed, but it's open. I couldn't go in earlier, but I

2273
03:54:48,300 --> 03:54:51,300
Its purpose was to protect the people of the Sentinel. It was aimed at eradicating categories and restoring order.

2274
03:54:51,300 --> 03:54:54,180
maintenance work, but life in the city becomes difficult and various groups

2275
03:54:54,180 --> 03:54:57,300
Starting precisely, Cent quickly becomes the hound of the powerful.

2276
03:54:57,300 --> 03:55:01,800
Turned out they were the perfect tools to control the city, obedient and suspicious

2277
03:55:01,800 --> 03:55:05,760
After the end of mankind, they continue to

2278
03:55:05,760 --> 03:55:10,760
I'm in control, I'm always doing my duty relentlessly

2279
03:55:10,800 --> 03:55:12,660
something

2280
03:55:12,660 --> 03:55:16,640
I am proud of having collected a lot of memories

2281
03:55:17,399 --> 03:55:22,640
I've lost a tooth anywhere

2282
03:55:22,739 --> 03:55:29,120
I don't think I can do this right now, but I don't think I've seen this before.

2283
03:55:29,340 --> 03:55:35,180
Oh no way this is the stairs behind

2284
03:55:39,479 --> 03:55:43,640
It's an Amazon nightclub

2285
03:55:47,819 --> 03:55:51,979
I have to go up, but is there a way up?

2286
03:56:00,060 --> 03:56:03,500
'Cause I think I'll have to go up

2287
03:56:05,939 --> 03:56:08,840
this guy

2288
03:56:18,359 --> 03:56:22,460
Hi, how did you get up here? Do you want to party with us?

2289
03:56:38,040 --> 03:56:43,560
Touch it, let's talk, kid having fun, you know this

2290
03:56:43,560 --> 03:56:49,199
I don't know how to use it, I stole this. The sea you can't imagine

2291
03:56:49,199 --> 03:56:51,859
where did you steal

2292
03:56:54,840 --> 03:56:57,560
Hey what is this dragon

2293
03:56:58,979 --> 03:57:01,800
I like my mask so I made it myself

2294
03:57:01,800 --> 03:57:07,160
It interferes with the Sentinel's scans and doesn't even look cool.

2295
03:57:08,819 --> 03:57:11,960
oh you look like

2296
03:57:13,340 --> 03:57:16,760
It's like you

2297
03:57:19,340 --> 03:57:25,020
I paid the security guard extra money to get the dance moves today.

2298
03:57:25,020 --> 03:57:28,819
program holograms in your spare time

2299

[Music] Bartender there guest VIP balcony nail

2300
03:57:37,620 --> 03:57:43,640
I went in and was using it privately. I think someone called Blazer made a reservation.

2301
03:57:57,510 --> 03:58:05,340
[Music] Left right beep beep this is me

2302
03:58:05,340 --> 03:58:07,760

2303
03:58:08,160 --> 03:58:10,439
this [music]

2304
03:58:10,439 --> 03:58:14,220
The club sucks. That pathetic person tried to go to the VIP room

2305
03:58:14,220 --> 03:58:20,100
I kicked it out trust me so I just stole this lever in retaliation

2306
03:58:20,100 --> 03:58:24,300
Bring me a drink and I'll give you this useless lever

2307
03:58:24,300 --> 03:58:28,380
If you bring a drink

2308
03:58:28,380 --> 03:58:31,460
It shines

2309
03:58:44,040 --> 03:58:49,640
I got the lever handle. It's delicious.

2310
03:58:56,580 --> 03:58:59,580
everyone

2311
03:59:01,319 --> 03:59:03,739

I want to try this I can't do this right now

2315
03:59:17,150 --> 03:59:20,389
[music]

2316
03:59:20,819 --> 03:59:25,730
I want to try this.

2317
03:59:25,730 --> 03:59:29,580
[music] uh

2318
03:59:29,580 --> 03:59:31,699
lever

2319
03:59:36,380 --> 03:59:39,979
ah nice now

2320
03:59:48,720 --> 03:59:51,620
came up

2321
03:59:55,199 --> 04:00:00,020
Oh, you can find the memory before it goes up. Wait a minute.

2322
04:00:00,840 --> 04:00:03,920
I can't find it when I go up

2323
04:00:13,220 --> 04:00:16,699
uh what is this

2324
04:00:17,040 --> 04:00:20,650
Ah, this looks like an elevator, I guess.

2325
04:00:20,650 --> 04:00:23,880
[MUSIC] Ah

2326
04:00:23,880 --> 04:00:26,300
hey this is

2327
04:00:27,540 --> 04:00:32,340
It's a place only mischievous people can find.

2328
04:00:37,439 --> 04:00:41,699
When I was human, I got together with my friends and partyed all night. Thanks to you, the next day

2329
04:00:41,699 --> 04:00:46,560
It was always hard in the morning, rather than going to an unlivable surface, I had fun here

2330
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:52,340
It felt good to find it, but the conditions in underground life were getting worse and worse.

2331
04:00:52,439 --> 04:00:57,660
The capitalist greed of corporations such as corporations and the police state created by Sentinels are also more

2332
04:00:57,660 --> 04:01:02,580
It got ugly Now I remembered why we ended up like this

2333
04:01:02,580 --> 04:01:09,500
Wow ah two ah my teeth are falling out It's bittersweet

2334
04:01:22,140 --> 04:01:27,560
Oh, I hope it feels like making a little road

2335
04:01:27,560 --> 04:01:31,040
I'll have to look around each one

2336
04:01:36,660 --> 04:01:41,230
Uh, that’s it, it’s it, it’s it

2337
04:01:41,230 --> 04:01:48,440
[music]

2338
04:01:49,199 --> 04:01:53,040
Blaze, where are you going?

2339
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:55,520
toilet kana

2340
04:01:55,600 --> 04:02:01,260
[Music] Nice to meet you

2341
04:02:01,260 --> 04:02:04,080
I also have a very good relationship with the Sentinels.

2342
04:02:04,080 --> 04:02:09,020
I don't know why the other kids complain about Centerrail so much

2343
04:02:15,660 --> 04:02:21,960
I'm tied to Clementa, but I can't believe he's a blazer trash

2344
04:02:21,960 --> 04:02:26,640
It's crazy, you're as smart as you think

2345
04:02:26,640 --> 04:02:29,880
It's not because I have bad feelings for the little cat anyway, it's just

2346
04:02:29,880 --> 04:02:32,420
it's just business

2347
04:02:34,260 --> 04:02:37,500
It was a betrayal, ever since I said goodbye

2348
04:02:37,500 --> 04:02:39,600
I did [music]

2349
04:02:39,600 --> 04:02:43,800
Gold necklaces are business, and money is more money than stains or camaraderie

2350
04:02:43,800 --> 04:02:47,540
Take everything you think is important

2351
04:02:49,750 --> 04:02:57,979
[Music] I heard your favorite sound just now

2352
04:03:00,239 --> 04:03:06,560
Uh where did my bag go

2353
04:03:14,040 --> 04:03:19,160
That's right, I'm a smart cat

2354
04:03:41,340 --> 04:03:46,939
I'll have to shoot the prison prison break

2355
04:03:50,939 --> 04:03:53,899
do this

2356
04:04:05,460 --> 04:04:09,439
Genius genius, there is nothing you can't do, there is nothing you can't do

2357
04:04:14,220 --> 04:04:16,220
omg

2358
04:04:16,260 --> 04:04:18,859
I guess you're being tortured

2359
04:04:21,720 --> 04:04:25,340
Are you doing something like an electric shock?

2360
04:04:29,460 --> 04:04:32,540
I have to go in here

2361
04:04:46,920 --> 04:04:49,699
don't get caught

2362
04:04:55,380 --> 04:04:58,699
going down here

2363
04:05:01,620 --> 04:05:04,460
I can go into all the rooms

2364
04:05:05,399 --> 04:05:09,479
Oh, you should go down right away, but you can ask for it quickly

2365
04:05:09,479 --> 04:05:23,089
Because of the timing [music]

2366
04:05:39,979 --> 04:05:43,220
waiting waiting

2367
04:05:50,180 --> 04:05:53,479
uh here it is

2368
04:05:53,580 --> 04:05:55,760
found

2369
04:05:56,760 --> 04:06:02,120
Hey, the rain is gone, the rain is over there

2370
04:06:04,260 --> 04:06:08,100
Since there is no rain right now, we can't communicate with the cat.

2371
04:06:08,100 --> 04:06:10,399
very

2372
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:15,800
with cat

2373
04:06:28,520 --> 04:06:31,760
Because I don't have a bag

2374
04:06:35,460 --> 04:06:39,199
It's inconvenient because I don't have a bag

2375
04:06:45,300 --> 04:06:48,020
brought

2376
04:06:50,710 --> 04:06:55,859
[Music] [Applause]

2377
04:06:55,859 --> 04:07:01,040
Let's go, follow me I got it

2378
04:07:02,760 --> 04:07:05,180
where should i go

2379
04:07:29,660 --> 04:07:35,239
I don't know what you're talking about

2380
04:07:47,100 --> 04:07:51,080
The cat is so cute right? The small one at the back

2381
04:07:53,939 --> 04:07:58,020

04:08:16,380 --> 04:08:20,939
Oh, I think it's going to be a little tough here, but the choice is to come out and leave

2386
04:08:20,939 --> 04:08:25,560
I want to go, I should just throw it away and live with this feeling

I felt like I was on a computer system in a lab again.

Thoroughly lonely, you, me, me, I, the child who came back to you

04:12:51,479 --> 04:12:55,040
I can't believe you are a good friend

I'm glad we can be together, but it's not safe yet

did you have lag what are you doing

2429
04:13:30,140 --> 04:13:37,340
Ah, iRobot, what is it all of a sudden?

2430
04:13:38,399 --> 04:13:41,120
Got a trojan horse

04:13:42,120 --> 04:13:44,600
I was surprised

04:13:53,939 --> 04:14:00,979
Come to your senses, do it quickly. What are you doing? Talk to me.

Hey, I really have to repay the favor for my whole life, but Clementine

At this rate, the Sentinel is blocking the road again.

2437
04:14:45,659 --> 04:14:50,220
If you do this, you will be caught soon. You go to the cell.

2438
04:14:50,220 --> 04:14:53,540
It's like luring them in and then locking them up

2441
04:15:08,840 --> 04:15:13,260
I see that guy on the floor over there. He's a rebooted robot. I lost my memory.

2442
04:15:13,260 --> 04:15:16,100
I don't want to, I'm so scared

2443
04:15:19,680 --> 04:15:23,810
I think I need to do something here after luring it out.

2444
04:15:23,810 --> 04:15:27,030
[music]

2445
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:36,180
This recovery center has helped me the most. My mind is clear and clear.

2446
04:15:36,180 --> 04:15:39,260
What food am I now

2447
04:15:42,899 --> 04:15:49,040
Should I keep it here, but I can't use it first

2448
04:15:59,580 --> 04:16:05,100
Wow, he's tough. Ah, should I have done Yoo-in first?

2449
04:16:05,100 --> 04:16:07,520
I can't come in

2450
04:16:34,439 --> 04:16:37,220

04:16:51,120 --> 04:16:53,540
everyone

2452
04:16:57,479 --> 04:17:01,500
It's a memory, it looks like the last one, then

2453
04:17:01,500 --> 04:17:05,300
That's right, this is the end of normal memory. Then

2454
04:17:09,239 --> 04:17:14,340
The ending is approaching, but the poor fellow Sentinel is resisting

2455
04:17:14,340 --> 04:17:17,600
You seem ruthless to me

2456
04:17:18,239 --> 04:17:22,680
As far as I'm concerned, they deleted this guy completely. No more emotions.

2457
04:17:22,680 --> 04:17:27,620
I have neither awareness nor memory.

2458

Ah 98% of men

Ah, but he's a problem. I have to bring him too.

2464
04:18:39,180 --> 04:18:42,540
Oh if this

2465
04:19:17,760 --> 04:19:20,120

What else do I have to do

2467
04:19:32,520 --> 04:19:36,859
Uh, I feel like something could come out now

2468
04:19:45,680 --> 04:19:49,680
The only way out of here is to come out in the reenactment room over there.

2469
04:19:49,680 --> 04:19:52,620
Looks like a way to access the control room

2470
04:19:52,620 --> 04:19:55,939
Let's find out

2471
04:19:57,899 --> 04:20:01,520
there is a switch here

okay

04:20:28,739 --> 04:20:31,580
my key

2476
04:20:31,859 --> 04:20:36,960
You're lucky, the key is stuck in the door, so get on

2477
04:20:36,960 --> 04:20:41,600
Go beyond and climb behind the deals you can now access

You're one of us now, not everyone has to go outsider

04:27:44,279 --> 04:27:49,140
That's right, I'm soft

2542
04:28:05,819 --> 04:28:08,120
what

2543
04:28:08,399 --> 04:28:11,779
I see what else you need

2544
04:28:13,560 --> 04:28:17,960
What can I do now I don't think I'll make it now

2545
04:28:19,760 --> 04:28:24,319
What were each of you doing?

2546
04:28:27,779 --> 04:28:30,800
yes this is the correct answer

2547
04:28:40,979 --> 04:28:44,520
This is the control room for the whole city, I controlled everything from here and now

2548
04:28:44,520 --> 04:28:50,040
Nothing, nothing, I remember I hated them

2549
04:28:50,040 --> 04:28:54,300
They've got it all, clean space, infinite power movement car, but

2550
04:28:54,300 --> 04:29:01,939
They didn't use it properly. Epidemic. I remembered now.

2551
04:29:02,279 --> 04:29:05,819
Everyone was dying, but they only thought of themselves. Nothing helps.

2552
04:29:05,819 --> 04:29:10,500
I saw my family dying in front of my eyes. I felt helpless.

2553
04:29:10,500 --> 04:29:14,300
there was nothing I could do for

2554
04:29:14,600 --> 04:29:19,920
But I can help you now and we can go outside together

2555
04:29:19,920 --> 04:29:24,140
Humanity, I will keep the memories of the people I loved

2556
04:29:27,180 --> 04:29:33,000
Oh really uh 92% of men what is uh 98% not

2557
04:29:33,000 --> 04:29:39,920
Ah well, in terms of numbers, it can be 92%

2558
04:29:44,220 --> 04:29:47,779
this is my main computer

2559
04:29:54,540 --> 04:29:58,859
According to the mainframe, no one has been here for years. It's been a while.

2560
04:29:58,859 --> 04:30:02,340
The whole city is stuck in a lockdown cycle, disable it and we'll get out too.

2561
04:30:02,340 --> 04:30:06,180
You'll be able to online the rest of this system

2562
04:30:06,180 --> 04:30:10,800
The data we need is this computer

2563
04:30:10,800 --> 04:30:13,100
in

2564
04:30:14,040 --> 04:30:19,880
While you turn on the power, I will find the system access password encryption key

2565
04:30:22,500 --> 04:30:24,859
it's heart

2566
04:30:25,319 --> 04:30:29,239
Now, just tell me what to do

2567
04:30:29,300 --> 04:30:33,620
The child is all growing up, right?

2568
04:30:40,859 --> 04:30:46,580
I deliberately set it up to turn it on while passing by at once like this.

2569
04:30:48,620 --> 04:30:52,159
my big picture

2570
04:30:52,620 --> 04:30:57,479
I'm so glad I succeeded I found a friend I figured out how to open a city here

2571
04:30:57,479 --> 04:31:01,439
I saw that there was something wrong.

2572
04:31:01,439 --> 04:31:04,220
there must be a way

2573
04:31:06,750 --> 04:31:10,380
[music] rope

2574
04:31:10,380 --> 04:31:12,560
control

2575
04:31:14,040 --> 04:31:20,120
That's a workstation that opens the city. It has a security layer, so I can't use it.

2576
04:31:20,159 --> 04:31:23,640
Let's do what we do best, hack the rig and you destroy it

2577
04:31:23,640 --> 04:31:26,840
Shall I break it? Shall I break something?

2578
04:31:26,840 --> 04:31:31,880
I'll send you all this

2579
04:31:39,720 --> 04:31:45,199
Now, let's do one thing. Then, where else?

2580
04:32:04,410 --> 04:32:07,469
[music]

2581
04:32:14,000 --> 04:32:19,979
Ah, it seems that hacking can do this too.

2582
04:32:19,979 --> 04:32:24,140
what is what

2583
04:32:28,319 --> 04:32:30,620
tango

2584
04:32:31,319 --> 04:32:35,279
Ah, I guess this is just a story, right?

2585
04:32:35,279 --> 04:32:37,819
I think it's a story

2586
04:32:43,920 --> 04:32:47,110
[music]

2587
04:32:52,380 --> 04:32:55,580
[music]

2588
04:32:57,479 --> 04:33:04,159
Arch, I did that last one earlier, but I didn’t. I have to hack this again here.

2589
04:33:05,219 --> 04:33:10,520
Hey, is there any hacking here? There is one left, but it was here

2590
04:33:11,349 --> 04:33:15,240
[MUSIC] Something slowed down

2591
04:33:15,240 --> 04:33:17,959
He's not exploding [Music]

2592
04:33:17,959 --> 04:33:23,939
Ah, it started again, I think I broke my body to pretend to be sick

2593
04:33:23,939 --> 04:33:28,939
I'll be fine. Just take me to the workstation. I can turn that alarm off.

2594
04:33:28,980 --> 04:33:32,119
It's quick again

2595
04:33:41,340 --> 04:33:43,639
okay now

2596
04:33:45,061 --> 04:33:50,279
There's something to say, but, but you trash man, you can do it.

2597
04:33:50,279 --> 04:33:53,580
Cheer up a little bit more, anyway, just remove the battery and I'll take you there

2598
04:33:53,580 --> 04:33:56,840
I just need to put in the charger.

2599
04:33:57,719 --> 04:34:01,740
We know that it takes a lot of power to bring down the city's central control system.

2600
04:34:01,740 --> 04:34:06,299
I knew more than this drone fuselage could hold out now.

2601
04:34:06,299 --> 04:34:09,480
Security is disabled, so I can't control the system and open the city.

2602
04:34:09,480 --> 04:34:12,539
Covering this could destroy my software.

2603
04:34:12,539 --> 04:34:16,920
Yes but I made that choice when I first connected it to my computer and now

2604
04:34:16,920 --> 04:34:21,061
This is the result. We can't see the outside together.

2605
04:34:21,061 --> 04:34:25,260
I'm sorry, I thought I had to carry on the memories of mankind, I had to hold onto the past

2606
04:34:25,260 --> 04:34:29,580
But now I see the future from the campaigners and

2607
04:34:29,580 --> 04:34:34,100
Come on, I'll take this off of you too.

2608
04:34:35,520 --> 04:34:39,220
You were the best friend I've ever been, thank you

2609
04:34:39,220 --> 04:34:47,959

2610
04:34:50,100 --> 04:35:11,529

You saved the real world, you cat, go after me

2614
04:35:42,539 --> 04:35:49,139
what's there [music]

2615
04:35:53,459 --> 04:35:56,900
How long did they play? In the end, I did it, the cat

2616
04:35:56,900 --> 04:36:02,380
Oh my god, the cat finally did it, this is unbelievable

2617
04:36:02,380 --> 04:36:07,249
[music]

2618
04:36:09,180 --> 04:36:12,719
what the sentinels

2619
04:36:12,719 --> 04:36:15,859
Clementine is still alive

2620
04:36:16,740 --> 04:36:26,809
[music]

2621
04:36:34,500 --> 04:36:36,859
I'm not taking you

2622
04:36:40,100 --> 04:36:45,619
I can't believe I went through hardship here

2623
04:36:49,219 --> 04:36:52,879
for 6 hours

2624
04:36:56,340 --> 04:37:01,879
Where can I go in advance?

2625
04:37:06,299 --> 04:37:09,299
No, even the cat is relentless, just how

2626
04:37:09,299 --> 04:37:15,080
So I might be able to save it, but watch him just throw it away

2627
04:37:20,639 --> 04:37:23,359
Also cats

2628
04:37:24,959 --> 04:37:28,340
If it was a puppy, I would have taken it a little longer.

2629
04:37:34,740 --> 04:37:37,740
pigeons

2630
04:37:42,980 --> 04:37:46,219
long time no see

2631
04:37:54,000 --> 04:37:57,859
Do you want to meet your friends? Do you want to meet them now?

2632
04:37:57,919 --> 04:38:11,769
[music]

2633
04:38:17,699 --> 04:38:22,580
What was that at the end, what was it trying to tell you?

2634
04:38:26,340 --> 04:38:28,500
long [music]

2635
04:38:28,500 --> 04:38:32,119
in 5 hours 50 minutes

2636
04:38:32,400 --> 04:38:36,779
Cleared Stray

2637
04:38:36,779 --> 04:38:42,240
It was a very good cat game and I just couldn't get the achievements and badges.

2638
04:38:42,240 --> 04:38:45,240
I had a hard time

2639
04:38:46,160 --> 04:38:51,719
First of all, the regrettable thing was that I worked hard to collect it, and in the end, I was naked

2640
04:38:51,719 --> 04:38:57,000
Going out tells the players this

2641
04:38:57,000 --> 04:38:59,061
That's right

2642
04:38:59,279 --> 04:39:04,439
What kind of nonsense was this?

2643
04:39:04,439 --> 04:39:08,459
Does it have any meaning, but still 92%

2644
04:39:08,459 --> 04:39:13,379
I worked hard to eat memory. Okay, everyone worked hard, and here

2645
04:39:13,379 --> 04:39:16,859
I'll finish it. Okay

2646
